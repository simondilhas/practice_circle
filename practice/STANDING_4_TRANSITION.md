# Standing Practice – Stage 4  
**Transition: Standing Under Pressure**

---

### Purpose
To verify relaxation and awareness when symmetry is broken.  
The practitioner learns to remain calm, upright, and connected while one side of the body bears more load or external stress.

This is not strength training but *stability testing.*

---

### Posture
- Begin from the balanced stance of Stage 3.  
- Step one foot half to one stride forward.  
- Front foot points ahead, rear foot turned out slightly (10–15°).  
- Keep both feet flat on the floor.

#### Weight Distribution
- Settle **70 % of the weight on the front leg**, 30 % on the rear.  
- Spine remains vertical; do not lean forward.  
- Feel the load pass through hip, knee, ankle into the ground.  
- Switch sides after each round.

#### Alignment
- Pelvis level, not twisted.  
- Crown and perineum aligned vertically.  
- Shoulders stay open and relaxed.

### Arms
Asymmetrical arm position mirrors the asymmetrical stance:

- **Front hand** (same side as front leg): raised to **breast height**, palm open and facing forward or slightly angled inward.  
  - Elbow bent naturally, not locked.  
  - As if gently pushing or offering something ahead.  
- **Rear hand**: rests at **lower belly height** (near dantian), palm facing body or slightly downward.  
  - This hand anchors and grounds the posture.  
- Keep both shoulders relaxed and level.  
- When switching legs, switch arm positions accordingly.

> The front hand extends; the rear hand roots.  
> Together they balance forward pressure with internal stability.

### Breathing
- Keep breath natural; do not brace.  
- Notice how breath travels differently through loaded and unloaded sides.  
- Allow exhale to release any tightening in the legs.

### Eyes
- **Reintroduce open eyes** after the deep internal work of Stage 3.  
- Lids slightly lowered, gaze soft and steady, not fixed on any one point.  
- Peripheral vision stays active — you sense the space around you.  
- Open eyes support balance and spatial awareness during asymmetrical loading.  
- This prepares you to maintain presence while moving through space (Stage 5).

---

### Mental Focus
- Attention stays in both feet simultaneously.  
- Observe how the mind reacts to asymmetry — impatience, effort, imbalance.  
- Do not fix or fight it; stay with sensation until it evens out.  
- Small tremors are normal; forcing stillness is not.

### Variations
1. **Short Bow Stance** – 70/30 load, moderate distance.  
2. **Long Bow Stance** – 80/20, lower and wider; use only after months of adaptation.  
3. **Side Stance** – step to the side, shifting load left/right evenly; trains lateral stability.  
4. **Micro-Shifts** – within each stance, gently feel pressure flow forward/back without visible movement.

---

### Routine
- 15–25 minutes per side, alternating.  
- End each session with neutral standing (Stage 3 posture) to reset.  
- Walk slowly afterward to release residual tension.

---

### Signs of Progress
- Load feels springy, not heavy.  
- Breathing remains steady under effort.  
- Mind quiet even in discomfort.  
- Transitions between sides smooth and balanced.

---

### Common Errors
| Issue | Correction |
|--------|------------|
| Leaning forward | Keep crown over perineum |
| Collapsing rear knee | Keep both legs engaged, not locked |
| Forcing strength | Shorten stance, return to relaxation |
| Ignoring fatigue | Alternate sides frequently |

---

### Goal
Stability that remains calm under asymmetry — presence tested, not lost.

---

### When to Explore Stage 5
When you can shift weight smoothly between stances without bracing, and notice tension arising in daily life (walking, sitting, speaking) — you're ready.  
Stage 5 isn't a new posture; it's standing wherever you are. The practice dissolves into life.
