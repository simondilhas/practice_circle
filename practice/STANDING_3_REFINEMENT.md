# Standing Practice – Stage 3  
**Refinement: Integrating Stillness and Awareness**

---

### Purpose
Unify posture, breath, and attention so the whole body breathes as one.  
Transform stability into living presence.

**Duration:** ongoing practice.

---

### Posture
- Same stance as Stage 2; seek subtle alignment, not greater endurance.  
- Feel a gentle connection between soles and crown.

---

### Arms
- Begin with the **ball-holding position** from Stage 2 (chest height, palms facing).  
- After 10–15 minutes of stillness, introduce **slow rotations** to explore dynamic relaxation:
  - Rotate both arms horizontally — left arm forward while right pulls back, then reverse.  
  - Move as if turning a large wheel or sphere in front of the body.  
  - Keep shoulders dropped; motion comes from waist and spine, not arms alone.  
  - Each rotation takes 8–12 seconds; maintain continuous smooth flow.  
- Alternate: 10 minutes still, 3–5 minutes rotating, return to stillness.  
- Hands may also shift height during long holds: belly, chest, forehead — test where relaxation deepens.

> The rotations teach you to remain centered while the body moves.  
> Stillness is not rigidity.

#### Feet
- Maintain the **parallel alignment** from Stage 2.
- Feel the whole sole contact the ground evenly — front, back, inside, and outside edges.
- Sense a gentle “drawing together” through the arches without gripping.
- Let awareness extend downward through the floor, as if standing on water yet completely stable.


---

### Focus
- Rest awareness in the body's centre.  
- Observe tiny internal movements without interfering.  
- Breath becomes quiet and diffuse; mind alert but still.

### Eyes
- **Eyes closed** throughout the practice.  
- With posture and breath now stable, closed eyes allow you to sense subtle internal movements and whole-body breathing without distraction.  
- Full attention turns inward — observing tiny shifts, vibrations, and the integration of awareness through the entire body.  
- This deepens the refinement that Stage 3 cultivates.

---

### Routine
- 30–60 minutes, 3–4 times weekly.  
- Alternate with walking or sitting practice.  
- Begin and end with brief shaking or stretching.

---

### Signs of Progress
- Spontaneous whole-body breathing.  
- Calm vitality after standing, no heaviness.  
- Clear attention during daily activity.

### Common Errors
| Issue | Correction |
|--------|------------|
| Forcing concentration | Return to relaxed awareness |
| Losing body sense | Ground attention in soles and breath |
| Seeking experiences | Stay with simplicity |
| Neglecting recovery | Include walking and rest |

---

### Goal
Presence that persists beyond posture — stillness within movement and thought.

> "When the standing ends, the practice begins."

### When to Explore Stage 4
When 30+ minutes of standing feels like clear, calm presence rather than endurance, and your breath adjusts naturally without thought — step one foot forward and test asymmetry.  
Reopen your eyes. If you stay grounded and curious under the uneven load, Stage 4 is calling.
