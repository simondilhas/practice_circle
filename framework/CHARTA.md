# Operational Charter — The Practice Circles

## 1. Purpose
We meet weekly to train **attention**, **honesty**, and **compassion** — strengthening clarity and integrity in daily life.

---

## 2. Meeting Rhythm

- **Frequency:** Once per week, 60–90 minutes  
- **Group Size:** 6–10 members  
  - When membership exceeds 10, the circle splits into two autonomous groups.  
- **Attendance:** Participation is the practice. Absence is acceptable but should be communicated.

---

## 3. Session Structure

### Opening (10 minutes)
Each person states:  
> “My name is [name]. Today I’m here for [intention].”

No commentary or discussion.  
Purpose: simple honesty and presence.

### Practice (40 minutes)
- Silent standing meditation (sitting allowed if needed).  
- One facilitator keeps time; no guidance during the session.  
- Phones off, minimal movement, full attention.

attendance
### Closing (10–15 minutes)
- Each member writes a short reflection:
  - What did I notice?  
  - What challenged me?  
  - What intention arises for the week?  
- Sharing is optional.  
- End with a short bow or brief acknowledgment of the group.

---

## 4. Daily Practice
Members maintain an individual practice (minimal 15 minutes daily) between sessions.  
Form is flexible, standing, walking, journaling, but consistency is not.

---

## 5. Documentation and Research
- Each circle keeps basic records: attendance, anonymized reflections, and group changes.  
- Data is used to refine understanding and improve methods.  
- Structural changes are introduced **one at a time** and tested in practice.  
> *One adaptation at a time, never compromising existing principles.*

---

## 6. Governance
- Roles (facilitator, treasurer, scribe) rotate every 3 months.  
- All records, finances, and decisions are transparent to members.  
- The framework holds no permanent authority — only agreed procedure.

---

## 7. Conflict Resolution
- Conflicts are first addressed within the circle through open dialogue.  
- If unresolved, mediation is facilitated by **two members from other circles**.  
- Mediation seeks clarity, not punishment.  
- Leaving is always an accepted outcome.

---

## 8. Connection and Growth
- Each circle remains autonomous but accountable to shared ethics and peer review.  
- Circles share tools, documentation, and insights openly.  
- Coordination happens through **federation, not hierarchy**.

---

## 9. Departure
Members may leave at any time without stigma or penalty.  
Leaving is part of growth — **freedom is the safeguard of integrity**.

---
## 10. Tools, Not Oracles

We use technology to support reflection, not to replace it.  
Language models, data systems, and analysis tools may assist in documentation and pattern recognition, but all interpretation and decision remain human and procedural.  
Transparency in their use is required.  

→ The tools serve attention; they do not define it.
