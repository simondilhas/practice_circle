# Decision Meeting Protocol  

### Purpose
To make collective decisions in a way that maintains attention, honesty, and compassion — without voting or hierarchy.  
The goal is **clarity that everyone can live with**, not majority rule.

This protocol adapts the Quaker *Meeting for Business* model for a secular, practice-based framework.

---

## 1. Preparation

- Decision meetings are separate from practice sessions.  
  They use the same spirit of presence but focus on practical matters.  
- The **facilitator (clerk)** prepares and circulates a short written agenda in advance.  
- Participants review agenda items beforehand to allow calm reflection.  
- The **scribe** is appointed to record all minutes and decisions neutrally.

---

## 2. Opening

1. **Begin with silence (2–3 minutes)** to settle attention.  
2. The facilitator reads a short statement of purpose, e.g.:  
   > “We are here to listen carefully and find a course of action that reflects our shared understanding.”

---

## 3. Speaking and Listening

- Each person speaks **once per topic**, unless invited again by the facilitator.  
- Speak briefly and sincerely — describe what you see, not what others should think.  
- No direct debate, correction, or interruption.  
- After every contribution, allow a few breaths of silence before another person speaks.  

> Silence is part of the decision-making process, not an absence of it.

---

## 4. Recording and Agreement

- The scribe summarizes each contribution neutrally (no names, only content).  
- When a potential decision becomes clear, the facilitator drafts a **minute** aloud:  
  > “It seems the sense of the group is that we will [decision].”

- The group sits in silence to test the minute.  
  - If someone feels it does not reflect the shared sense, they say so.  
  - The facilitator rephrases until no one objects in substance.

Consensus means **“I can live with this”**, not **“I got my way.”**  
Once confirmed, the minute is recorded in the circle’s documentation.

---

## 5. When No Unity Emerges

If the group cannot reach agreement:

1. The facilitator notes:  
   > “We are not yet clear on this matter.”  
2. The topic is postponed to the next decision meeting.  
3. A small **working pair or triad** may refine proposals in the meantime.

Deadlock is not failure — clarity requires patience.

---

## 6. Closing

- End with one minute of silence.  
- The scribe reads all confirmed minutes aloud.  
- The facilitator thanks participants and closes the meeting.  
- The written minutes are uploaded to the circle’s shared record  
  (e.g. `/circle_records/2025-10_DECISIONS.md`).

---

## 7. Federation Process

When a circle proposes a change that affects the shared Charter or Protocols:

1. The proposal is submitted to **two peer circles** for independent review.  
2. If both confirm that it does not conflict with core principles,  
   the proposal is logged in the **Federation Governance Log**.  
3. Other circles may adopt, adapt, or observe it in practice.

> The federation evolves through documented peer review, not authority.

---

## 8. Cultural Guidelines

- The facilitator serves the **process**, not the outcome.  
- Every voice is equal in value.  
- Experience gives perspective, not rank.  
- Records, not personalities, hold authority.  

> Decisions arise from attention, not persuasion.
