# Mentorship & Rotation Protocol

### Purpose
This protocol defines how guidance, learning, and leadership rotation function inside **The Practice Circle**.  
Its aim is to allow growth through experience **without creating hierarchy or dependency**.

---

## 1. Principle

> Wisdom may guide, but it must never rule.

Experience is valuable, but authority in The Practice Circle remains **procedural, not personal**.  
Mentorship and facilitation exist to share skill and insight — not to establish rank.

---

## 2. Mentorship

### 2.1 Definition
A **mentorship** is a temporary, transparent learning relationship between two members for the purpose of improving personal practice or facilitation skill.

### 2.2 Terms
- **Duration:** Limited to one defined period (e.g. four weekly sessions or one quarter).  
- **Scope:** Practical guidance only — methods, focus, reflection habits.  
- **Transparency:** Each mentorship is logged in the circle record (names, start date, end date, topic).  
- **Dissolution:** Mentorship ends automatically at the set time. Renewal requires group consent.

### 2.3 Conduct
- Mentor shares perspective, not doctrine.  
  > “This is what I’ve found useful,” not “This is the right way.”  
- Mentee remains responsible for their own interpretation and experience.  
- Both reflect and record what they learned at the end of the period.

---

## 3. Rotation of Roles

### 3.1 Facilitator Rotation
- Facilitator roles rotate every 3 months (or sooner if agreed).  
- After serving, a facilitator takes a **rest period** of at least one cycle to prevent power accumulation.  
- Backup facilitators shadow current ones to ensure continuity.

### 3.2 Other Roles
- Treasurers, scribes, mediators, and coordinators also rotate regularly.  
- Each role maintains written handover notes so knowledge remains collective.

---

## 4. Recognition of Experience

Experienced members contribute by:
- Updating documentation and guides.  
- Leading time-bound workshops open to all circles.  
- Assisting new circles to start, then stepping back once self-sustaining.

Contribution grants **trust**, not **status**.  
Trust is maintained through transparency and relinquishment.

---

## 5. Feedback & Review

Every circle holds a **review meeting** every 3–6 months to ask:
1. Did we keep rotation active?  
2. Did any person become central or indispensable?  
3. Did mentorships end cleanly?  
4. Are new members being empowered to take roles?

Findings are logged in the circle record and shared with the federation for peer learning.

---

## 6. Shadowing and Succession

Each role has a designated **shadow** who learns its basic tasks.  
When the primary role-holder rotates out, the shadow steps in or trains the next shadow.  
This ensures resilience and continuity without hierarchy.

---

## 7. Language Discipline

Language shapes culture.  
Use phrasing that reflects provisional authority:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|--------------|
| “Our teacher said…” | “In one session, [Name] observed…” |
| “This is correct.” | “This is what we’re testing.” |
| “Ask [Name], they know.” | “Let’s compare experiences.” |

---

### Summary

- Experience guides; procedure governs.  
- Mentorships are temporary, transparent, and documented.  
- All roles rotate and have shadows.  
- Authority flows through process, not personality.  
- Growth is collective, not individual prestige.

> **Power circulates, or it stagnates.**
