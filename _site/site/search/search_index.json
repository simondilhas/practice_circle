What once was divine mystery became natural law; what once was the moment of creation is now located just a few moments after the Big Bang. But we should not forget that these are hypotheses \u2014 right until proven wrong.</p> <p>So ultimately, the spiritual traditions and modern physics agree on one thing: We cannot fully know or understand what lies beyond with the means available in this world.</p> <p>It boils down to belief. You can choose to believe in a transcendent reality \u2014 divine, energetic, or metaphysical \u2014 or you can choose not to. Both are valid positions, but neither can be verified through direct, repeatable observation.</p> <p>For this framework: We focus on what is directly observable. The body, the breath, the quality of attention, the patterns of tension and release \u2014 these can be studied, tested, and refined. We will see what we can discover through sustained practice and honest observation.</p> <p>This approach does not deny traditional goals. If your practice leads you toward experiences you interpret as spiritual, that is your path.

From time to time I returned to it, usually when fatigue, pain, or stress accumulated. Each time I noticed that practice \u2014 even for short sessions \u2014 had a clear stabilizing effect.</p> <p>In 2025, after my father's death and a long period of overwork, I restarted consistently. This period of illness and exhaustion made it obvious that I needed a method without performance, belief, or comparison \u2014 something that could reset the system directly through experience. Standing practice became that baseline.</p> <p>I realized that adding more activity on top of a stressed body does not work and that this was the mistake I constantly did before.
