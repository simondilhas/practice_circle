# Standing Practice – Stage 4  
**Transition: Standing Under Pressure**


### Posture
- Begin from the balanced stance of Stage 3.  
- Step one foot half to one stride forward.  
- Front foot points ahead, rear foot turned out slightly (10–15°).  
- Keep both feet flat on the floor.

#### Weight Distribution
- Settle **70 % of the weight on the front leg**, 30 % on the rear.  
- Spine remains vertical; do not lean forward.  
- Feel the load pass through hip, knee, ankle into the ground.  
- Switch sides after each round.

#### Alignment
- Pelvis level, not twisted.  
- Crown and perineum aligned vertically.  
- Shoulders stay open and relaxed.


### Breathing
- Keep breath natural; do not brace.  
- Notice how breath travels differently through loaded and unloaded sides.  
- Allow exhale to release any tightening in the legs.

### Eyes
- **Reintroduce open eyes** after the deep internal work of Stage 3.  
- Lids slightly lowered, gaze soft and steady, not fixed on any one point.  
- Peripheral vision stays active — you sense the space around you.  
- Open eyes support balance and spatial awareness during asymmetrical loading.  
- This prepares you to maintain presence while moving through space (Stage 5).


### Variations
1. **Short Bow Stance** – 70/30 load, moderate distance.  
2. **Long Bow Stance** – 80/20, lower and wider; use only after months of adaptation.  
3. **Side Stance** – step to the side, shifting load left/right evenly; trains lateral stability.  
4. **Micro-Shifts** – within each stance, gently feel pressure flow forward/back without visible movement.


### Signs of Progress
- Load feels springy, not heavy.  
- Breathing remains steady under effort.  
- Mind quiet even in discomfort.  
- Transitions between sides smooth and balanced.


### Goal
Stability that remains calm under asymmetry — presence tested, not lost.
