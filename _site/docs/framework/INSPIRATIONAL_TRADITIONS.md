### Purpose

## 4. Synthesis for The Practice Circle

From East and West we inherit complementary strengths:

| Source | We Keep | We Drop |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Quaker discipline | Consensus, rotation, transparency | Moral conformity |
| Zen embodiment | Postural and breath discipline | Hierarchy |
| Stoic reflection | Rational self-observation | Emotional suppression |
| Ubuntu councils | Communal listening | Deference to elders |
| Gandhian service | Ethics in labor | Personality cults |
| Benedictine rhythm | Balance of work and rest | Clerical obedience |
| Sufi devotion | Emotional depth | Secrecy |
| Aikido motion | Conflict as training | Rank culture |

**Integration Principle:**  
Each tradition solved a piece of the same puzzle —  
how to live with clarity, compassion, and integrity together.  
The Practice Circle recombines these solutions into a secular, transparent, and iterative framework.

> We do not imitate traditions; we distill their functional wisdom.  
> The same human search for clarity runs through every culture.  
> The Practice Circle continues that experiment for our time.
