# Decision Meeting Protocol  

### Purpose
To make collective decisions in a way that maintains attention, honesty, and compassion — without voting or hierarchy.  
The goal is **clarity that everyone can live with**, not majority rule.

This protocol adapts the Quaker *Meeting for Business* model for a secular, practice-based framework.


## 2. Opening

1. **Begin with silence (2–3 minutes)** to settle attention.  
2. The facilitator reads a short statement of purpose, e.g.:  
   > “We are here to listen carefully and find a course of action that reflects our shared understanding.”


## 4. Recording and Agreement

- The scribe summarizes each contribution neutrally (no names, only content).  
- When a potential decision becomes clear, the facilitator drafts a **minute** aloud:  
  > “It seems the sense of the group is that we will [decision].”

- The group sits in silence to test the minute.  
  - If someone feels it does not reflect the shared sense, they say so.  
  - The facilitator rephrases until no one objects in substance.

Consensus means **“I can live with this”**, not **“I got my way.”**  
Once confirmed, the minute is recorded in the circle’s documentation.


## 6. Closing

- End with one minute of silence.  
- The scribe reads all confirmed minutes aloud.  
- The facilitator thanks participants and closes the meeting.  
- The written minutes are uploaded to the circle’s shared record  
  (e.g. `/circle_records/2025-10_DECISIONS.md`).


## 8. Cultural Guidelines

- The facilitator serves the **process**, not the outcome.  
- Every voice is equal in value.  
- Experience gives perspective, not rank.  
- Records, not personalities, hold authority.  

> Decisions arise from attention, not persuasion.
