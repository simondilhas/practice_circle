2. **[Charta](framework/CHARTA.md)** – Learn how circles operate and maintain integrity.
3. **[Practice Intro](practice/STANDING_0_INTRO.md)** – Discover the core practice and progression stages.
4. **[Facilitator Guide](facilitator/FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md)** – Understand how circles are facilitated (whether you plan to facilitate or not).
