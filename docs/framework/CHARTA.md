# Operational Charter — The Practice Circles

# Practice Circle Charter

## Purpose  
The Charter brings the concepts of the **Manifesto** into lived practice.  
It translates principles into structure — defining how we work, train, decide, and evolve together.  
Its purpose is to anchor our actions in experience, align critical thinking with practice,  
and ensure that shared responsibility is reflected in every process of the Practice Circle.

The Charter defines **principles of practice** that unite inner cultivation, collective inquiry,  
and transparent collaboration. Detailed methods are provided in the attached **Howto documents**.

## Commitments  

### 1. I Practice Every Day — Because It Unites Body and Mind, Cultivating Skillful Living  
Practice means any disciplined method that cultivates embodied awareness and attentive presence.  
All members begin with **daily standing practice** as a direct, physical entry point into awareness —  
learning to root attention in stillness, balance, and breath.  
If standing is not possible, use sitting; if sitting is not possible, use lying down.  
What matters is the uprightness of attention, not the posture itself.  

From this stable base, practice may expand into other forms that connect mind and body —  
any method that trains presence and deepens clarity in relation to life and work.  
Continuity, not variety, is the measure of progress.  
Practice remains meaningful only when it can be **observed, shared, and refined**.

### 2. I Document My Practice — To Make It Visible and Enable Collective Improvement 
I document what I do, what I notice, and what I learn — so that my process can be understood, questioned, and built upon.  
This record allows both personal reflection and collective refinement — turning data into insight, and effort into shared learning. 

→ [How to document the practice](../framework/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md)


---

### 3. I Share Decisions, Responsibility, and Information — To Keep the Work Stable and Prevent Dependence on Strong Leaders  

I take part in collective decision-making, follow agreed procedures, and keep my work visible to others.  
Authority is procedural, not personal; clarity and documentation hold power, not individuals.  
By sharing decisions, accountability, and information, we prevent hierarchy, preserve trust, and ensure that the circle continues even when members change.

### 4. I Commit to Conflict Resolution Through Dialogue —  To Protect Trust and Prevent Corruption
When conflict arises, I address it directly and with honesty.  
I seek understanding before judgment, clarity before reaction.  
If resolution cannot be found within the circle, I support mediation by two peers from other circles.  
Mediation seeks clarity, not victory.  
Leaving is always an honorable option — freedom safeguards integrity.  

→ [How to resolve conflicts](../framework/CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md)

### 5. I Support Evolution and Freedom — To Keep the Circle Alive and Honest  

I recognize that everything we build must remain open to change.  
The framework evolves through testing, reflection, and collective consent, not through authority.  
I contribute to revisions transparently and accept that others may continue differently.  
Leaving the circle is always an honorable option;  
freedom protects integrity, and evolution protects life.

### Summary  
*The Practice Circle brings the Manifesto to life — through practice that becomes documentation,  
documentation that enables refinement, and refinement that leads to shared understanding and transparent evolution.*
