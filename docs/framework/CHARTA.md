# Operational Charter — The Practice Circles

## 1. Purpose
We meet weekly to train **attention**, **honesty**, and **compassion** — strengthening clarity and integrity in daily life.

---

## 2. Practice Formats

The Practice Circles recognize three complementary formats, each serving different needs and contexts:

### Solo Practice
- **Individual daily practice** (minimum 15 minutes)
- Self-directed form: standing, walking, sitting, or journaling
- Foundation for all other formats
- No formal structure required, but consistency is essential

### Online Ad Hoc Circle
- **Flexible, drop-in format** for remote participation
- Scheduled sessions (e.g., daily or weekly time slots)
- No long-term commitment required
- Minimal structure: brief check-in, timed practice, closing
- Serves as entry point or supplement to fixed circles

### In-Person Fixed Circle
- **Committed weekly group** of 6–10 members
- Full session structure with governance and documentation
- Primary format for depth, accountability, and collective refinement
- Details outlined in sections below

All formats share the same core intention. Members may participate in multiple formats simultaneously.

---

## 3. Meeting Rhythm (In-Person Fixed Circles)

- **Frequency:** Once per week, 60–90 minutes  
- **Group Size:** 6–10 members  
  - When membership exceeds 10, the circle splits into two autonomous groups.  
- **Attendance:** Participation is the practice. Absence is acceptable but should be communicated.

---

## 4. Session Structure (In-Person Fixed Circles)

### Opening (10 minutes)
Each person states:  
> “My name is [name]. Today I’m here for [intention].”

No commentary or discussion.  
Purpose: simple honesty and presence.

### Practice (40 minutes)
- Silent standing meditation (sitting allowed if needed).  
- One facilitator keeps time; no guidance during the session.  
- Phones off, minimal movement, full attention.

### Closing (10–15 minutes)
- Each member writes a short reflection:
  - What did I notice?  
  - What challenged me?  
  - What intention arises for the week?  
- Sharing is optional.  
- End with a short bow or brief acknowledgment of the group.

---

## 5. Daily Practice Commitment
Members of fixed circles maintain an individual practice (minimum 15 minutes daily) between sessions.  
Form is flexible — standing, walking, sitting, journaling — but consistency is essential.

---

## 6. Documentation and Research (In-Person Fixed Circles)
- Each circle keeps basic records: attendance, anonymized reflections, and group changes.  
- Data is used to refine understanding and improve methods.  
- Structural changes are introduced **one at a time** and tested in practice.  
> *One adaptation at a time, never compromising existing principles.*

For guidelines on personal practice logs and experiential research, see **[PRACTICE_METHODOLOGY.md](../research/PRACTICE_METHODOLOGY.md)**.

---

## 7. Governance (In-Person Fixed Circles)
- Roles (facilitator, treasurer, scribe) rotate every 3 months.  
- All records, finances, and decisions are transparent to members.  
- The framework holds no permanent authority — only agreed procedure.

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution
- Conflicts are first addressed within the circle through open dialogue.  
- If unresolved, mediation is facilitated by **two members from other circles**.  
- Mediation seeks clarity, not punishment.  
- Leaving is always an accepted outcome.

---

## 9. Connection and Growth
- Each circle remains autonomous but accountable to shared ethics and peer review.  
- Circles share tools, documentation, and insights openly.  
- Coordination happens through **federation, not hierarchy**.

---

## 10. Document Governance

These documents are **living guidelines, not scripture**. They evolve through transparent peer review.

### Change Process
- All modifications happen through **pull requests** (visible, discussable, versioned)
- Reviews use **Quaker-inspired discernment** — seeking unity, not majority vote
- Approvals mean "I sense this serves the intention"
- Blocks are rare, reserved for core principle violations
- Minor improvements (typos, clarity) require 1 approval
- Structural changes require 2 approvals from different contexts
- Core principle changes require broader circle consensus
- Minimum 48-hour reflection period for non-urgent changes

### Review Principles
Changes should:
- **Protect core**: Maintain attention, honesty, compassion as foundation
- **Enable evolution**: Welcome new formats, clearer language, tested adaptations
- **Preserve autonomy**: No hierarchy, no dogma, no barriers to participation

### Experimental Testing
- Significant changes should be **tested in practice first** using experimental branches
- After testing period, hold **formal review meeting**
- **Testers are centered**: Those with direct experience lead discussion
- **Others may attend**: Those affected can listen, question, raise concerns
- **Experience carries weight**: Those who tested speak from practice
- Meeting uses Quaker discernment to determine: Adopt / Revise / Defer / Decline
- Minimum testers required:
  - Format tweaks: 3-5 people
  - Structure changes: 6-10 people (one full circle)
  - Governance changes: 10-20 people (multiple circles)
  - Core principles: 15+ people (multiple circles, extended discernment)

### Reversibility
- Changes can be reverted if they prove harmful in practice
- One adaptation at a time, evaluated through use
- Theory serves practice, not the reverse

See **[HOW_WE_CHANGE.md](HOW_WE_CHANGE.md)** for detailed guidelines and experimental branch process.

## 11. Departure
Members may leave at any time without stigma or penalty.  
Leaving is part of growth — **freedom is the safeguard of integrity**.

---
## 12. Tools, Not Oracles
We use technology to support reflection, not to replace it.  
Language models, data systems, and analysis tools may assist in documentation and pattern recognition, but all interpretation and decision remain human and procedural.  
Transparency in their use is required.  

→ The tools serve attention; they do not define it.
