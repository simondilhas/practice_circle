# Appendix: Practice Formats

This appendix provides detailed guidance for the three complementary practice formats recognized by the Practice Circles. Each format serves different needs, contexts, and levels of commitment while sharing the same core intention of training attention, honesty, and compassion.

---

## Overview

The Practice Circles framework recognizes that different practitioners have different circumstances, needs, and capacities. The three formats create a flexible ecosystem:

- **Solo Practice**: The foundation — individual daily cultivation
- **Online Ad Hoc Circle**: The gateway — flexible, accessible connection
- **In-Person Fixed Circle**: The crucible — committed depth and collective refinement

Members may participate in multiple formats simultaneously. Each format stands on its own while supporting the others.

---

## 1. Solo Practice

### Purpose
Individual daily practice is the foundation of all other formats. Without consistent personal practice, group sessions become social gatherings rather than shared cultivation spaces.

### Structure
- **Duration**: Minimum 15 minutes daily
- **Forms**: Self-directed choice among:
  - Standing meditation (zhan zhuang)
  - Walking meditation
  - Sitting meditation
  - Contemplative journaling
  - Other mindful movement practices

### Guidelines
- **Consistency over intensity**: Daily practice is more valuable than occasional long sessions
- **No formal structure required**: Practice should adapt to your life, not dominate it
- **Self-accountability**: Track your practice honestly, but without self-judgment
- **Foundation for participation**: Solo practice supports meaningful engagement in group formats

### Documentation (Optional)
While solo practitioners are not required to document, basic tracking supports progress:
- Simple log of practice time and form
- Brief notes on observations or challenges
- Patterns noticed over weeks or months

See [PRACTICE_METHODOLOGY.md](../research/PRACTICE_METHODOLOGY.md) for detailed guidance.

### Integration
- Solo practice may begin before joining any circle
- It continues between and beyond group sessions
- Personal insights inform collective understanding
- Individual consistency supports group stability

---

## 2. Online Ad Hoc Circle

### Purpose
The Online Ad Hoc Circle provides flexible, accessible practice sessions for those who:
- Are exploring whether to commit to a fixed circle
- Cannot attend in-person sessions regularly
- Want supplemental practice between fixed circle meetings
- Live in areas without established circles
- Prefer low-commitment connection with fellow practitioners

### Structure
- **Format**: Drop-in video sessions (Zoom, Jitsi, or similar)
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes
- **Schedule**: Regular time slots (e.g., daily 7am, or weekly Sunday 6pm)
- **Group Size**: Flexible, typically 3-15 participants
- **Commitment**: No long-term obligation — attend when it serves you

### Session Flow

#### Opening (5 minutes)
- Brief tech check (mics muted, cameras optional)
- Each person states their name and brief intention (one sentence)
- Facilitator announces practice duration

#### Practice (20-45 minutes)
- Cameras on or off based on personal preference
- Mics muted
- Timed silent practice:
  - Standing meditation (camera helpful for shared presence)
  - Sitting meditation
  - Walking (if space allows)
- Timer/bell to mark beginning and end

#### Closing (5 minutes)
- Optional brief sharing: "What did I notice?"
- Acknowledgment of collective practice
- Announcement of next session time

### Facilitation
- Rotating volunteer facilitators
- Minimal role: 
  - Send link/reminder
  - Keep time
  - Hold space (no teaching or guidance)
- Training not required, but clarity about format is essential

### Technology Considerations
- Use stable, accessible platforms
- Provide clear joining instructions
- Backup plan for technical failures
- Consider recording policy (default: no recordings)

### Documentation
- Basic attendance records (optional, for understanding patterns)
- No formal reflections required
- Participants may keep personal notes

### Boundaries
What Ad Hoc Circles **are not**:
- Not therapy or counseling sessions
- Not teaching or instruction forums
- Not social chatting groups
- Not spaces for proselytizing or recruiting
- Not substitutes for consistent solo practice

### Starting an Online Ad Hoc Circle
1. Choose a regular time slot
2. Set up consistent meeting link
3. Share in practice community channels
4. Prepare brief format description for newcomers
5. Find 1-2 backup facilitators
6. Maintain the schedule reliably (or announce pauses)

---

## 3. In-Person Fixed Circle

### Purpose
The In-Person Fixed Circle is the primary format for:
- Deep, sustained practice development
- Collective accountability and mutual support
- Governance participation and skill development
- Systematic documentation and research contribution
- Long-term practitioner relationships

This is the "full" format described in the main CHARTA document.

### Core Commitments

#### Practice Commitment
- **Daily individual practice**: Minimum 15 minutes
- **Weekly attendance**: Once per week, 60-90 minutes
- **Consistency**: Regular participation (communicate absences)

#### Governance Participation
- Share in rotating roles (facilitator, treasurer, scribe)
- Participate in circle decisions using discernment process
- Contribute to document reviews when changes affect circle practice
- Maintain transparency in finances and records

#### Documentation Commitment
- Keep practice logs (see [PRACTICE_METHODOLOGY.md](../research/PRACTICE_METHODOLOGY.md))
- Write brief weekly reflections
- Contribute to circle records and anonymized research data
- Support systematic understanding of practice development

### Session Structure

Full structure is detailed in CHARTA Section 4:

#### Opening (10 minutes)
Each person states:
> "My name is [name]. Today I'm here for [intention]."

#### Practice (40 minutes)
- Silent standing meditation (sitting allowed if needed)
- Minimal movement, phones off, full attention
- One facilitator keeps time; no guidance during session

#### Closing (10-15 minutes)
- Written reflection:
  - What did I notice?
  - What challenged me?
  - What intention arises for the week?
- Optional sharing
- Brief closing acknowledgment

### Group Size and Scaling
- **Optimal size**: 6-10 members
- **Below 6**: Consider merging with another circle or recruiting
- **Above 10**: Plan to split into two autonomous circles
  - Allow 2-3 months for transition
  - Form new leadership roles organically
  - Maintain connection between circles

### Role Rotation
Every 3 months, roles rotate:
- **Facilitator**: Timekeeping, space preparation, session flow
- **Treasurer**: Finances (space rental, supplies), transparent accounting
- **Scribe**: Record-keeping, documentation, anonymized research logs

All members cycle through all roles. Experience is shared.

### Meeting Logistics
- **Location**: Quiet, stable space (community center, private space, outdoors if weather permits)
- **Scheduling**: Fixed day and time (consistency enables attendance)
- **Space requirements**:
  - Enough room for all to stand with arms extended
  - Minimal distractions (visual, auditory)
  - Comfortable temperature
  - Seating available for closing reflection

### Financial Model
- **Principle**: Cost-sharing, not profit
- **Typical costs**:
  - Space rental (if needed)
  - Basic supplies (timer, cushions, tea)
  - Document printing (optional)
- **Sliding scale**: Those with more support those with less
- **Transparency**: All expenses visible to all members
- **No payment for teaching**: Facilitation is service, not profession

### Conflict and Resolution
- Address tensions directly and early
- Use circle dialogue first
- Seek mediation from two members of other circles if needed
- Prioritize clarity over comfort
- Remember: leaving is always acceptable

### Connection with Other Circles
- Share insights, tools, and documentation openly
- Participate in inter-circle reviews of framework changes
- Offer mediation support when requested
- Coordinate through federation, not hierarchy
- Learn from other circles' experiments and adaptations

### Starting an In-Person Fixed Circle
See [HOW_TO_CREATE_A_CIRCLE.md](HOW_TO_CREATE_A_CIRCLE.md) for detailed guidance on:
- Finding initial members
- Establishing first sessions
- Setting up governance
- Creating documentation systems
- Connecting with existing circles

## 4. Format Transitions and Combinations

### From Solo to Group
- Begin with solo practice to establish foundation
- Attend Online Ad Hoc sessions to experience collective practice
- When ready for commitment, join or form Fixed Circle
- Continue solo practice throughout

### Parallel Participation
Many practitioners engage in multiple formats:
- Daily solo practice (foundation)
- Weekly Fixed Circle (depth and accountability)
- Occasional Ad Hoc sessions (supplemental connection)

This is natural and encouraged. Different formats serve different needs.

### Stepping Back
Life circumstances change. Options include:
- Move from Fixed Circle to Ad Hoc participation
- Maintain only solo practice for a period
- Pause all structured practice mindfully
- Return when circumstances allow

No stigma attaches to any transition. The practice serves life, not vice versa.

### Format Innovation
These three formats are not exhaustive. Possible adaptations might include:
- Monthly extended practice (half-day or full-day sessions)
- Walking meditation circles in nature
- Silent retreats organized by multiple circles
- Workplace lunchtime drop-in sessions

**Important**: New formats should:
- Maintain core intention (attention, honesty, compassion)
- Be tested experimentally before formal adoption
- Be documented and shared for collective learning
- Remain accessible and non-hierarchical

See [HOW_WE_CHANGE.md](HOW_WE_CHANGE.md) for experimental adaptation process.

## 5. Common Questions

### Can I practice alone without joining any circle?
Yes. Solo practice is complete in itself. Group formats enhance but don't replace individual practice.

### How do I know which format is right for me?
Start where you are:
- New to practice → Solo, then Ad Hoc
- Seeking consistency → Ad Hoc, then Fixed
- Ready for commitment → Fixed Circle
- Limited time → Solo with occasional Ad Hoc

### Can children participate?
- Solo practice: Yes, adapted to age and capacity
- Ad Hoc: Ages 16+ (with younger if accompanied by guardian)
- Fixed Circle: Ages 18+ (or 16+ with circle consensus and guardian awareness)

### What if my city has no circles?
1. Establish solo practice
2. Join online Ad Hoc circles
3. When ready, start a Fixed Circle (see HOW_TO_CREATE_A_CIRCLE.md)

### Are there teachers or advanced practitioners?
No. We have **experienced practitioners**, but no formal hierarchy. 
- Those who have practiced longer may share experience
- All interpretations are provisional, tested in practice
- No one holds authority over another's practice

### What about accessibility needs?
All formats adapt to physical capacity:
- Standing can become sitting
- Movement practices can be modified
- Online options support those unable to travel
- Costs are shared (sliding scale, no one excluded for finances)

### How do formats interact with research?
- Solo practice: Optional documentation
- Ad Hoc: Basic attendance patterns (anonymous)
- Fixed Circle: Systematic logs and reflections
- All data: Anonymized, used only for collective understanding

## 6. Format Principles

Across all three formats, certain principles remain constant:

### Practice Principles
- **Attention**: Full presence to direct experience
- **Honesty**: Clear seeing without self-deception  
- **Compassion**: Kindness toward self and others

### Structural Principles
- **Autonomy**: Each circle self-governs
- **Accessibility**: No barriers of money, dogma, or hierarchy
- **Transparency**: All decisions, finances, and changes are visible
- **Evolution**: Structures adapt based on practice experience
- **Non-coercion**: Freedom to participate, to leave, to return

### Relational Principles
- **Mutual support**: We practice together, not in competition
- **Shared responsibility**: Roles rotate, all contribute
- **Direct communication**: Address tensions honestly and kindly
- **Collective learning**: Share insights and challenges openly

---

## Closing Note

These formats are **tools for practice, not institutions to defend**. They serve attention, honesty, and compassion. When a format no longer serves, it should change or be released.

Practice comes first. Structure follows.
