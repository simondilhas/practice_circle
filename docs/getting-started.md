Start with the [Manifesto](index.md) to understand why we exist and what principles guide us.

## 2. How-To Guides — Learn how to practice and organize

Explore the [How-To Guides](howto/) to understand how to practice standing meditation and how circles function with shared power and accountability.

## 3. Practice — Discover the core practice and progression

Explore the [Standing Meditation](howto/practice/standing_meditation/0_intro.md) to learn about the stages of standing meditation.
