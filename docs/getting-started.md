<h3>For Thinkers</h3>

<p><em>Start with reading, then practice</em></p>

<h4>1. Manifesto — Why We Exist</h4>

<h4>2. How-To Guides — Practicing and Organizing Together</h4>
<p>Visit the <a href="/howto/index.html">How-To Guides</a> to learn how circles practice, document, and make decisions through shared responsibility and clear procedures.</p>

<p>Begin with <a href="/howto/practice/standing_meditation/0_intro.html">Standing Meditation</a>.<br>
This is the foundation — awareness rooted in the body.</p>

<p><em>Once you've taken these first steps, explore any section that resonates with your current stage of practice.<br>
In The Practice Circle, understanding grows from experience — not the other way around.</em></p>

<h3>For Doers</h3>

<p><em>Start with doing, not reading</em></p>

<h4>1. Find a Quiet Place</h4>
<p><strong>Stop. Stand still. Focus on your feet. Relax.<br>
That's already the practice.</strong></p>

<h4>2. Make a Circle</h4>
<p>Draw a small circle with chalk, stones or branches.<br>
Add a few pairs of footprints on the line.<br>
Anyone can stand there, together or alone.</p>

<h4>3. Practice</h4>
<p>Step onto one of the footprints.<br>
Stand still for a few minutes.<br>
No talking, no phones. Just notice your breath and weight.<br>
Then step away quietly.</p>

<h4>4. Share</h4>
<p>If you want, take a photo from above or from a distance.<br>
Write where it was and what you noticed.<br>
You can share it online on social media or document it on GitHub.</p>

<h4>5. Learn More</h4>
<p>If you want to understand the idea behind it, read the<br>
<a href="manifesto.html">Manifesto</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>You don't need permission to start.<br>
The circle exists when someone draws it and stands still.<br>
Everything else grows from that.</em></p>
