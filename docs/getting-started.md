# Getting Started

Welcome to The Practice Circle. If you're new here, we recommend reading these three documents in order:

## 1. Manifesto — Learn what we stand for

Start with the [Manifesto](index.md) to understand why we exist and what principles guide us.

## 2. Charta — Learn how circles operate and maintain integrity

Read the [Charta](framework/CHARTA.md) to understand how circles function with shared power and accountability.

## 3. Practice — Discover the core practice and progression

Explore the [Practice](practice/STANDING_0_INTRO.md) to learn about the stages of standing meditation.
