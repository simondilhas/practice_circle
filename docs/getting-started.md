## ðŸ§  For Thinkers

*Start with understanding, then practice*

This is the foundation â€” awareness rooted in the body.

*Once you've taken these first steps, explore any section that resonates with your current stage of practice.  
In The Practice Circle, understanding grows from experience â€” not the other way around.*

## âœ‹ For Doers

*Start with doing, not reading*

**Find a quiet spot. Stop. Stand still. Focus on your feet. Relax.  
That's already the practice.**

### 1. Make a Circle
Draw a small circle with chalk â€” about 2â€“3 meters wide.  
Add five pairs of footprints on the line.  
Anyone can stand there, together or alone.  
(See [How to Make a Circle](how_to_circle.md))

### 2. Practice
Step onto one of the footprints.  
Stand still for a minute or two.  
No talking, no phones. Just notice your breath and weight.  
Then step away quietly.

### 3. Share (Optional)
If you want, take a photo from above or from a distance.  
Write where it was and what you noticed.  
You can share it online or document it on GitHub.  

### 4. Learn More
If you want to understand the idea behind it, read the  
[Manifesto](manifesto.md).

### 5. Contribute (Optional)
Found a clearer way to explain or draw it?  
Propose it on GitHub:  
[How to Contribute Changes](howto/organize/protocols/contribute_changes.md)

*You don't need permission to start.  
The circle exists when someone draws it and stands still.  
Everything else grows from that.*
