<h2>For Doers</h2>

<p><em>Start with doing, not reading</em></p>

<h3>1. Find a Quiet Place</h3>
<p><strong>Stop. Stand still. Focus on your feet. Relax.<br>
That's already the practice.</strong></p>

<h3>2. Make a Circle</h3>
<p>Draw a small circle with chalk — about 2–3 meters wide.<br>
Add a few pairs of footprints on the line.<br>
Anyone can stand there, together or alone.<br>
(See <a href="how_to_circle.md">How to Make a Circle</a>)</p>

<h3>3. Practice</h3>
<p>Step onto one of the footprints.<br>
Stand still for a minute or two.<br>
No talking, no phones. Just notice your breath and weight.<br>
Then step away quietly.</p>

<h3>4. Share</h3>
<p>If you want, take a photo from above or from a distance.<br>
Write where it was and what you noticed.<br>
You can share it online or document it on GitHub.</p>

<h3>5. Learn More</h3>
<p>If you want to understand the idea behind it, read the<br>
<a href="manifesto.md">Manifesto</a>.</p>

<h3>6. Contribute (Optional)</h3>
<p>Found a clearer way to explain or draw it?<br>
Propose it on GitHub:<br>
<a href="howto/organize/protocols/contribute_changes.md">How to Contribute Changes</a></p>

<hr>

<p><em>You don't need permission to start.<br>
The circle exists when someone draws it and stands still.<br>
Everything else grows from that.</em></p>
