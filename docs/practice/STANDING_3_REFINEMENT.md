# Standing Practice – Stage 3  
**Refinement: Integrating Stillness and Awareness**


### Posture
- Same stance as Stage 2; seek subtle alignment, not greater endurance.  
- Feel a gentle connection between soles and crown.


#### Feet
- Maintain the **parallel alignment** from Stage 2.
- Feel the whole sole contact the ground evenly — front, back, inside, and outside edges.
- Sense a gentle “drawing together” through the arches without gripping.
- Let awareness extend downward through the floor, as if standing on water yet completely stable.



### Routine
- 30–60 minutes, 3–4 times weekly.  
- Alternate with walking or sitting practice.  
- Begin and end with brief shaking or stretching.


### Common Errors
| Issue | Correction |
|--------|------------|
| Forcing concentration | Return to relaxed awareness |
| Losing body sense | Ground attention in soles and breath |
| Seeking experiences | Stay with simplicity |
| Neglecting recovery | Include walking and rest |


### When to Explore Stage 4
When 30+ minutes of standing feels like clear, calm presence rather than endurance, and your breath adjusts naturally without thought — step one foot forward and test asymmetry.  
Reopen your eyes. If you stay grounded and curious under the uneven load, Stage 4 is calling.
