# Practice Circle  
*A living network of small, self-organizing circles for presence, dialogue, and shared learning.*

Every person who joins a Practice Circle is a **co-creator**.  
We don’t follow leaders or fixed methods — we practice awareness, dialogue, and shared responsibility together.  
Each circle evolves through the people who show up.

## Why Practice Circles?

Because awareness, listening, and shared power can’t be taught — they have to be practiced.

Each circle is:

- Small (10 people, if bigger the circle is split in two)  
- Self-organizing and peer-led  
- Focused on lived experience, not ideology  
- Supported by simple tools for documentation and reflection

Together, these circles form a decentralized learning network — one that grows through shared practice, not hierarchy.

## What Happens in a Circle


- Meet weekly or bi-weekly (online or local)  
- Check-in
- Begin with a shared practice of standing medidation
- Explore an open question or theme  
- Rotate facilitation — everyone leads sometimes  
- Capture the practice in a shared repository  
- Reflect together on how the process evolves

The circle is both **method and mirror** — we learn about ourselves by practicing together.

## This Practice Is For

### 1. The Overloaded Modern Individual  
Feeling **disconnected, anxious, or exhausted** by the pace of modern life?  
This practice offers a **grounded, embodied way to rebuild clarity, balance, and calm** —  
a return to presence without retreating into old belief systems.  

---

### 2. The Reflective Practitioner  
Facilitators, educators, and practitioners in **mindfulness, movement, therapy, design, or creative work**  
who value **shared responsibility over hierarchy**.  
Here you’ll find a **transparent framework** for collaboration, documentation, and collective learning.  

---

### 3. The Seeker Beyond Religion  
Those looking for **spiritual depth and community** beyond traditional religion or commercial self-help.  
The Practice Circle offers **meaning without dogma**, **structure without control**, and **freedom with accountability** —  
a living practice instead of fixed belief.  

---

In every circle, everyone contributes — by listening, speaking, documenting, and showing up fully.

We’re in the **early wave** — refining the language, rhythm, and structure of the Practice Circle.  
By joining now, you can:

- **Times won’t get quieter** — learn to stay grounded and clear amid uncertainty.  
- **Systems won’t fix themselves** — help shape a way of working and relating that actually sustains people.

## The Practice Circle Ethos  

**1. Practice** — grounding awareness in the body through direct experience, not belief.  
**2. Documentation** — making practice visible so reflection becomes shared learning.  
**3. Shared Decisions and Responsibility** — authority remains procedural, not personal; clarity and accountability hold power.  
**4. Conflict Resolution Through Dialogue** — trust is protected by honesty, understanding, and mediation, not dominance.  
**5. Evolution and Freedom** — the framework stays open to change; freedom safeguards integrity, and evolution protects life.  

These principles hold the structure steady while allowing it to remain alive, honest, and adaptable.

## Who’s Behind the Initiative

## Who’s Behind the Initiative

- **Simon Dilhas** — Architect, project manager, and founder of a software consultancy — now initiator of the Practice Circle.  
His work bridges structure and presence: how we can build systems that support awareness, accountability, and freedom rather than suppress them.

The Practice Circle grew from personal necessity.  
After years of overwork, tension, and disconnection, Simon returned to standing practice — not as a cure, but as a way to rebuild stability from the ground up.  
The results were gradual and real: less anxiety, steadier focus, and a clearer sense of proportion in work and life.  

This experience became the seed for a collective experiment — to explore how **individual practice and shared structure** can sustain each other.  

The first circles are now forming — each participant becomes part of the story.  
Your name could be here as well.
