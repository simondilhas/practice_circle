# The Practice Circle

**The Practice Circle rebuilds resilience where power and doctrine erode it, through a shared, evolving tradition of attention.**

## About This Project

This is an experiment in building an internal tradition rooted in Western values—where authority is procedural, not personal. The structure outlives and overrides any personality. This living repository evolves through collective wisdom, practical experience, and peer review. All content is public and tracked through version control.

## Getting Started

If you're new here, we recommend reading in this order:

1. **[Manifesto](manifesto/MANIFESTO.md)** – Start here to understand why we exist and what principles guide us.
2. **[Charta](framework/CHARTA.md)** – Learn how circles operate and maintain integrity.
3. **[Practice Introduction](practice/STANDING_0_INTRO.md)** – Discover the core practice and progression stages.

Once you've read these foundational documents, explore the other sections based on your interests and needs.
