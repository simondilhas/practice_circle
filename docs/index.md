# The Practice Circle

**A network of people training attention, honesty, and compassion in ordinary life.**

This site contains the living documents that define and guide The Practice Circle. All content is public, versioned, and open to peer review.

## Getting Started

If you're new here, we recommend reading in this order:

1. **[Manifesto](manifesto/MANIFESTO.md)** – Start here to understand why we exist and what principles guide us.
2. **[Charta](framework/CHARTA.md)** – Learn how circles operate and maintain integrity.
3. **[Practice Introduction](practice/STANDING_0_INTRO.md)** – Discover the core practice and progression stages.
4. **[Facilitator Guide](facilitator/FACILITATOR_GUIDE.md)** – Understand how circles are facilitated (whether you plan to facilitate or not).

Once you've read these foundational documents, explore the other sections based on your interests and needs.
