# Practice Circle  
*A living network of small, self-organizing circles for presence, dialogue, and shared learning.*

Every person who joins a Practice Circle is a **co-creator**.  
We don’t follow leaders or fixed methods — we practice awareness, dialogue, and shared responsibility together.  
Each circle evolves through the people who show up.

## Why Practice Circles?

Because awareness, listening, and shared power can’t be taught — they have to be practiced.

Each circle is:

- Small (4–8 people)  
- Self-organizing and peer-led  
- Focused on lived experience, not ideology  
- Supported by simple tools for documentation and reflection

Together, these circles form a decentralized learning network — one that grows through shared practice, not hierarchy.

---

## What Happens in a Circle

- Meet weekly or bi-weekly (online or local)  
- Begin with a shared practice of attention or embodiment  
- Explore an open question or theme  
- Rotate facilitation — everyone leads sometimes  
- Capture insights in a shared pad or notebook  
- Reflect together on how the process evolves

The circle is both **method and mirror** — we learn about ourselves by practicing together.

---

## Who This Is For

- People curious about **presence, inquiry, and embodied learning**  
- Facilitators, teachers, or learners who value **shared power**  
- Practitioners from **movement, mindfulness, education, or systems work**  
- Anyone tired of passive learning and ready to **co-create**  

In every circle, everyone contributes — through listening, speaking, documenting, or simply showing up fully.

## The Practice Circle Ethos

**1. Practice** — attention, presence, and embodiment come first  
**2. Inquiry** — we question together instead of seeking fixed answers  
**3. Shared Power** — leadership and authorship circulate  
**4. Documentation** — reflection is how the network learns  
**5. Evolution** — every circle adapts to its members and context

These principles hold the form while allowing it to grow.
