# The Practice Circle

**Modern life lost its balance. We rebuild it through practice, not belief.**

We live in a world of constant production — working faster, knowing more, feeling less. The structures that once grounded meaning have dissolved, leaving many adrift in stress, disconnection, and burnout.

The Practice Circle offers a different path: **grounded, embodied practice** that trains attention, restores balance, and rebuilds connection.

No gurus. No faith. No easy answers.  
Just disciplined practice, honest documentation, and collective growth.

## What We Do

The Practice Circle is a **federation of small, self-organizing groups** that meet to practice, document, and refine awareness together.

We ground our work in:

- **Daily practice** — standing meditation and other embodied methods that unite body and mind
- **Documentation** — making our process visible, testable, and improvable
- **Shared responsibility** — distributed decision-making that prevents hierarchy and dependence
- **Conflict resolution** — addressing tensions with honesty and clarity
- **Evolution** — keeping the framework adaptive, transparent, and future-proof

From relaxed bodies come clear minds.  
From clear minds come honest circles.  
From honest circles comes a freer world.

## Get Started

Before diving into theory or structure, take a moment:

**Stand. Breathe. Feel your weight on the ground.**

Notice the tensions in your body. Awareness begins with direct experience, not concepts.
