# Research Studies on Standing Meditation (Zhan Zhuang / Tai Chi)

This collection summarizes peer-reviewed studies and scholarly reports exploring the physiological and psychological effects of **standing meditation** — particularly within the traditions of **Zhan Zhuang**, **Tai Chi**, and **Qigong**.  
Together, these studies provide empirical support for the claims in the *Practice Circle Manifesto* about attention, balance, interoception, and regulation through standing.

## Methodological Note

The quality and rigor of the available research vary considerably.  
Most studies are **small-sample**, **non-industrially funded**, and often **conducted in university settings** with limited budgets. Peer review standards differ between journals, and replication is rare.  

Despite these limitations, the findings consistently **point in the same direction**:  
standing-based meditative practices influence **autonomic regulation**, **balance**, **interoceptive awareness**, and **psychological stability**.  
The converging evidence across independent teams and methodologies suggests that the underlying physiological mechanisms are real, even if the current literature remains fragmented and underfunded.

**Summary:**  
Across methodologies — fNIRS imaging, balance testing, mood assessment, EEG, and heart-rate variability — evidence converges on a single conclusion:  
**prolonged, relaxed standing systematically regulates the nervous system, enhances proprioception and interoception, and supports cognitive clarity.**  
The field remains young and underfunded, yet it points consistently toward the same insight: **attention through the body changes both.**
