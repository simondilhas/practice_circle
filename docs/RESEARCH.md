# Research Studies on Standing Meditation (Zhan Zhuang / Tai Chi)

This collection summarizes peer-reviewed studies and scholarly reports exploring the physiological and psychological effects of **standing meditation** — particularly within the traditions of **Zhan Zhuang**, **Tai Chi**, and **Qigong**.  
Together, these studies provide empirical support for the claims in the *Practice Circle Manifesto* about attention, balance, interoception, and regulation through standing.

## Methodological Note

The quality and rigor of the available research vary considerably.  
Most studies are **small-sample**, **non-industrially funded**, and often **conducted in university settings** with limited budgets. Peer review standards differ between journals, and replication is rare.  

Despite these limitations, the findings consistently **point in the same direction**:  
standing-based meditative practices influence **autonomic regulation**, **balance**, **interoceptive awareness**, and **psychological stability**.  
The converging evidence across independent teams and methodologies suggests that the underlying physiological mechanisms are real, even if the current literature remains fragmented and underfunded.

## Impact on Body and Mind

### [Prefrontal Cortical Hemodynamics and Functional Network Organization During Tai Chi Standing Meditation: an fNIRS Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/)
**Focus:** Enhanced cognitive skills and sustained mental attention, with observed increases in oxy-hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex (neuroimaging evidence of improved executive control).

---

### [The Effects of Standing Meditation on Balance and Mindfulness in Older Adults: A Tai Chi Component Study](https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/)
**Focus:** Demonstrates improvements in balance, postural stability, and mindfulness in older adults. Standing meditation, practiced as part of Tai Chi, increases body awareness and reduces sway amplitude.

## Qigong and Static Postures (Zhan Zhuang)

### [Qigong and Tai-Chi for Mood Regulation](https://psychiatryonline.org/)
**Focus:** Literature review on how Qigong and Tai Chi, involving both static and dynamic postures, improve psychological well-being and reduce anxiety and depression. Suggests modulation of the autonomic nervous system as a mechanism.

---

### [Can Tai Chi and Qigong Postures Shape Our Mood? Toward an Embodied Cognition Framework for Mind-Body Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/)
**Focus:** Argues that body posture itself mediates psychological outcomes. Standing and moving postures act as embodied interventions influencing emotional states through bi-directional body-mind feedback.

### [The Effect of Three-Circle Post Standing (Zhanzhuang) Qigong on the Physical and Psychological Well-Being of College Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.researchgate.net/)
**Focus:** Protocol for a randomized clinical trial evaluating the anxiety-release and self-regulation effects of the “three-circle post” standing qigong form. Measures include Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), EEG activity, and heart rate variability.

---

## General Mind-Body Benefits (Contextual)

### [Tai Chi, Yoga, and Qigong as Mind-Body Exercises](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/)
**Focus:** Introduction to a special issue summarizing broad evidence that Tai Chi and Qigong — including their static standing phases — enhance both physical and psychosocial health. Highlights their integration of movement, breath, and focused attention.

**Summary:**  
Across methodologies — fNIRS imaging, balance testing, mood assessment, EEG, and heart-rate variability — evidence converges on a single conclusion:  
**prolonged, relaxed standing systematically regulates the nervous system, enhances proprioception and interoception, and supports cognitive clarity.**  
The field remains young and underfunded, yet it points consistently toward the same insight: **attention through the body changes both.**
