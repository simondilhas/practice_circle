# Federation Finances  
> Collective resources for shared infrastructure, research, and continuity.

---

## 1. Purpose

The federation manages expenses that serve all circles and ensure long-term stability.  
Its financial role is **custodial, not directive** — pooling resources for what no single circle can sustain alone.

Funds are used for:
- Shared communication and outreach  
- Research, documentation, and framework development  
- Technical infrastructure (platforms, storage, website, bookkeeping)  
- Inclusion support between circles  
- Modest salaries for administrative continuity  
- General overhead  

The goal is transparency and sufficiency — not accumulation or profit.

## 2. Budget Structure

A typical federation budget allocates:

| Category | Purpose | Recommended Share |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **25% Marketing & Communication** | Website, public outreach, visual materials, printing, social media | 25% |
| **25% Research & Development** | Method refinement, publications, documentation, peer review | 25% |
| **20% Salaries & Administration** | Modest compensation for part-time coordinators, accountants, or technical custodians | 20% |
| **15% Technology & Infrastructure** | Hosting, tools, maintenance, storage, domain, software licenses | 15% |
| **10% Inclusion & Support** | Support between circles, access funds, travel stipends, mediation | 10% |
| **5% Reserve** | Contingency and future investment | 5% |

Percentages are indicative — reviewed yearly through federation discernment.

## 3. Salary Guidelines

The federation may compensate individuals for essential coordination or specialized work that ensures continuity (e.g., bookkeeping, web maintenance, federation facilitation).

**Principles:**
1. **Transparency:** All payments and contracts are public to all circles.  
2. **Proportionality:** Compensation reflects hours and responsibility, not status.  
3. **Sufficiency, not profit:** Enough to sustain the contributor, not to create dependence.  
4. **Rotation:** No role is permanent; every paid position is reviewed yearly.  
5. **Voluntary baseline:** Circles and contributors may donate time beyond compensation.

**Suggested ranges (guideline):**
- Administrative or bookkeeping: modest hourly rate based on local living wage.  
- Technical / coordination roles: slightly higher, capped at 1.2× the local median hourly rate.  
- No full-time salaries; roles remain part-time to preserve voluntary spirit.

Payment can be made through the federation account, with records visible to all circles.

## 4. Oversight and Reporting

- Federation treasurer (rotating) maintains the shared ledger.  
- Quarterly summaries include:
  - Income by source (circle contributions, donations, grants)
  - Expenses by category
  - Current balance and commitments  
- Annual review meeting confirms or revises budget structure.  
- All records remain public to every member circle.

---

## 5. Funding Sources

- Circle contributions (recommended 25% of each circle’s income)
- Voluntary donations  
- Research or cultural grants (non-conditional)  
- Event fees for open workshops or publications  

No funding may come with conditions that limit freedom or integrity.
