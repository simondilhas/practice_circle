## Core Motifs

### 1. Circle  
- Central and obvious — represents unity, presence, and dialogue.  
- Encircles the name “The Practice Circle” to emphasize collective form.  
- May appear as a single, slightly irregular ring — alive, not mechanical.

### 2. Standing / Feet  
- Reference to the foundation of practice: **standing as direct contact with the ground.**  
- Suggests stability, embodiment, and readiness.  
- May include a subtle base line or grounded form within the circle.

### 3. Human, Not Perfect  
- Lines remain organic and uneven — **hand-drawn rather than geometric.**  
- Expresses honesty and imperfection.  
- Aligns with the ethos: *clarity without dogma, freedom with accountability.*

### 4. More Than One / Dialogue  
- Two or more forms in relation — figures, arcs, or openings.  
- Symbolizes **dialogue and mutual reflection.**  
- Avoids any central emblem of authority; emphasizes participation and exchange.

### 5. Power Button  
- Dual meaning:
  - **Power on** — awakening attention, entering presence.  
  - **Power off** — release from constant activation, stepping out of demand.  
- Embodies **the shift from doing to being.**  
- Suggests the practice as both connection and rest: turning away from the noise of modern life to recover balance.  
- The vertical line within the circle may represent both *initiation* and *pause.*

## Directional Notes
- Simplicity over symbolism.  
- The mark should hold quiet strength — **a visual breath.**  
- Works in stillness as well as motion.  
- Serves as reminder: *to stand, to notice, to power down into presence.*
