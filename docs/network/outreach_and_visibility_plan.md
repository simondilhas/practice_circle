# Outreach and Visibility Plan

## Purpose
To share the unfolding process of **The Practice Circle** with openness and consistency — documenting progress, inviting participation, and allowing the work to be seen without promotion.  
The goal is not to market, but to make practice and process visible.

## 1. Substack — Weekly Reflections

**Channel:** Simon’s existing Substack Building Stories. Goal to seperate after some time into an own substack.

**Purpose:**  
Publish weekly reflections on practice, formation, and evolution of the circle.  
These posts document learning and development, not opinion or advice.

**Format:**
- 1 post per week (approx. 500–800 words)  
- Combine:
  - Practical updates — what was practiced or tested  
  - Observations — what questions or tensions appeared
  - How the design of an organization workes
  - Reflections — what changed through practice  
- Occasional short image or video (e.g. logo sketches, circle photo)

**Tone:** Clear, direct, personal

## 2. YouTube — Spoken Documentation

**Channel:** Official *Practice Circle* YouTube.

**Purpose:**  
Turn documentation into short, spoken summaries — simple, reflective, and honest.  
Not teaching or promotion, but public reflection.

**Format:**
- 10–20 minute recordings  
- One or two voices (podcast-style dialogue or monologue)  
- Use of excerpts from the existing documentation  
- Optional automated summaries via language model tools

**Example Topics:**
- Why Standing  
- How Circles Form and Split  
- Making Practice Visible  
- The Logo: Power and Presence

**Link:** _To be added when live._

## 3. Monthly Meetups — Introduction Circle

**Purpose:**  
Offer direct experience of the practice for newcomers before formal joining.

**Format:**
- Monthly in-person session (approx. 90 minutes)
- Simple, repeatable structure

**Flow:**
1. Welcome and short context (10 min)  
2. Standing practice (30–40 min)  
3. Reflection and brief sharing (20 min)  
4. Open questions and closing (20 min)

**Facilitation:**  
Rotating circle members.  
Documentation: short written summary after each session.

## 4. Ad Hoc Circles — Public Practice Installations

**Purpose:**  
To make stillness and attention visible in public spaces through minimal, participatory setups.

**Prototype: “For Doers”**

### 1. Find a Quiet Place
Stop. Stand still. Focus on your feet. Relax.  
That’s already the practice.

### 2. Make a Circle
Draw a small circle with chalk — about 2–3 meters wide.  
Add a few pairs of footprints on the line.  
Anyone can stand there, together or alone.

### 3. Practice
Step onto one of the footprints.  
Stand still for a minute or two.  
No talking, no phones. Just notice your breath and weight.  
Then step away quietly.

### 4. Share
If you want, take a photo from a distance.  
Write where it was and what you noticed.  
You can share it online or record it in the collective documentation.

**Documentation for Each Event:**
- Date and location  
- Short reflection (what occurred, public response)  
- Photo or drawing (optional)

These records can later form part of a shared map or timeline of spontaneous circles.
