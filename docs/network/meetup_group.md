## Introtext
Who We Are
We are a small, self-organizing group practicing standing meditation and collective learning.
The Practice Circle is secular. No teachers, no dogma, no hierarchy.
We meet to train attention, honesty, and calm through direct experience rather than belief.

What We Do
Each meeting begins with a short intro followed by a period of silent standing meditation (about 30â€“40 minutes).
After practice, we sit together for open reflection and exchange.
The meeting closes with brief documentation so learning remains collective.

Why We Meet
To rebuild depth and clarity in daily life.
To stay grounded amid speed and uncertainty.
To grow a community based on shared practice rather than ideology.

Everyone is welcome.
No experience needed, only curiosity and willingness to stand still together.
The meetings a free of charge, a donation is welcome.
