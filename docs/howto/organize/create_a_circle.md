# How to Create a New Circle

## Purpose

This guide provides practical steps for founding a new practice circle. It walks you through preparation, member gathering, first meeting, and ongoing establishment.

Whether starting an **In-Person Fixed Circle**, **Online Ad Hoc Circle**, or exploring **Solo Practice**, this document offers guidance aligned with our core principles.

---

## Before You Begin

### 1. Clarify Your Intention

Ask yourself:
- **Why do I want to start a circle?**
- Am I seeking personal practice support, community, or both?
- What format serves this intention? (Solo, Online Ad Hoc, or In-Person Fixed)
- Am I willing to commit to the facilitator role initially?

**Important**: Starting a circle is not about being an expert or teacher. You're inviting people to practice together, not to follow you.

### 2. Understand the Formats

Three practice formats exist:

**Solo Practice**
- Individual daily practice (minimum 15 minutes)
- No group needed, just personal commitment
- Foundation for all other formats

**Online Ad Hoc Circle**
- Flexible, drop-in format
- Scheduled sessions (e.g., daily or weekly time slots)
- No long-term commitment required
- Minimal structure: brief check-in, timed practice, closing

**In-Person Fixed Circle**
- Committed weekly group of 6–10 members
- Full session structure with governance and documentation
- Primary format for depth, accountability, and collective refinement

This guide focuses primarily on **In-Person Fixed Circles**, but principles apply to all formats.

### 3. Study the Core Documents

Before founding, read thoroughly:
- [Manifesto](../../index.md) — Core principles and commitments
- [Standing Meditation](../practice/standing_meditation/0_intro.md) — What you'll actually be doing
- [How We Change](evolution.md) — How the circle evolves

---

## Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 Weeks)

### Choose a Format

Decide which format you're starting:
- **In-Person Fixed Circle**: Requires space, 6–10 committed members, weekly meetings
- **Online Ad Hoc Circle**: Requires video call platform, flexible schedule
- **Solo Practice**: Start alone, potentially invite others later

### Secure a Space (for In-Person Circles)

Requirements:
- Quiet, private, and accessible
- Large enough for 6–10 people standing with arms' width clearance
- Minimal distractions (no foot traffic, loud neighbors, etc.)
- Available consistently at the same time weekly

**Options**:
- Community centers
- Yoga studios (off-hours)
- Private homes (if space permits)
- Religious/spiritual centers (if non-denominational use allowed)
- Coworking spaces (after hours)

**Cost**: Aim for free or low-cost. If rental is needed, plan how costs will be shared transparently.

### Set a Time

- **Fixed schedule**: Same day, same time, every week
- **Duration**: 60–90 minutes
- **Test for conflicts**: Avoid major holidays, work schedules

### Prepare Materials

- Timer/phone with timer (for practice sessions)
- Notebooks and pens (for reflections)
- Copy of [Manifesto](../../index.md) (printed or digital access)
- Attendance sheet template
- Contact list for members

---

## Phase 2: Gathering Members (2-4 Weeks)

### How Many People?

- **Minimum**: 6 members (provides stability when people miss sessions)
- **Maximum**: 10 members (when exceeding 10, split into two autonomous circles)
- **Starting point**: Aim for 6–8 to allow room for growth

### Finding People

**Personal Networks**:
- Friends who've expressed interest in meditation, mindfulness, or personal development
- Colleagues seeking practices outside work identity
- Existing meditation or spiritual communities (if open to new formats)

**Public Invitation** (use carefully):
- Community bulletin boards
- Online local groups (Meetup, Facebook, neighborhood forums)
- Yoga studios, wellness centers

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't oversell or make promises about outcomes
- Don't position yourself as a teacher or guru
- Don't require shared beliefs or backgrounds

### First Conversation (Individual or Small Group)

When someone expresses interest, have an honest conversation:

**Explain clearly**:
- "This is a weekly commitment to practice attention together."
- "We stand in silence for 40 minutes, then reflect briefly."
- "There's no teacher, no dogma, no hierarchy."
- "We share roles and decisions transparently."

**Share the documents**:
- Send them the [Manifesto](../../index.md) and relevant [how-to guides](../)
- Ask them to read before committing

**Ask questions**:
- "What brings you to this?"
- "Can you commit to weekly attendance?"
- "Are you comfortable with shared governance?"

**Be honest about what you don't know**:
- "This is new for me too."
- "We'll learn together and adapt."

### Forming the Initial Group

Once 6+ people have committed:
1. **Send a calendar invite** with first meeting date, time, location
2. **Share all core documents** via email or shared folder
3. **Ask everyone to read** the Manifesto and Practice Introduction before the first meeting
4. **Set expectations**: "First meeting is about starting, not perfection."

---

## Phase 3: First Meeting

The first session sets the tone. Keep it simple, honest, and aligned with the structure.

### Before People Arrive

- Arrive early to set up the space
- Test the timer
- Have notebooks/pens ready
- Display or print the session structure (if helpful)

### Opening the First Session (15 minutes)

**1. Welcome and Context (5 min)**

Speak simply:
> "Welcome. This is our first session as a practice circle. We're here to train attention, honesty, and compassion. We're all beginners at this specific format, including me. There's no teacher here. We'll learn together.
>
> I've prepared based on the Manifesto, but after today, we'll decide together how to proceed. For now, let's follow the basic structure."

**2. Brief Introductions (10 min)**

Each person states (no discussion):
> "My name is [name]. I'm here because [brief reason]."

Keep it short. No commentary or questions yet.

### Practice Session (30-40 minutes)

**1. Explain Standing Meditation (5 min)**

Read or paraphrase from [Foundation Practice](../practice/STANDING_1_FOUNDATION.md):
- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
- Arms relaxed at sides (or hands gently folded)
- Eyes may be open (soft gaze downward) or closed
- Attention on the body, breath, or simply being present
- When attention wanders, notice and return (this is the practice)
- Sitting is allowed if standing is not possible

**2. Set the Timer (35 minutes suggested for first session)**

> "We'll practice for 35 minutes. I'll keep time. If you need to sit or adjust, do so quietly. Let's begin."

**3. Practice in Silence**

- One person (facilitator for now) keeps time
- No guidance, music, or speaking during practice
- Just silence and presence

**4. Close the Practice**

When timer ends:
> "The practice is complete. Take a moment, then we'll reflect."

### Closing (15-20 minutes)

**1. Written Reflection (5 min)**

Provide notebooks or paper. Ask everyone to write briefly:
- What did I notice?
- What challenged me?
- What intention arises for next week?

Explain: "Sharing is optional. Writing is for you, but it helps to have a record."

**2. Sharing (5-10 min, optional)**

> "If anyone wants to share something from their reflection, please do. No commentary or advice — just listening."

**3. Practical Next Steps (5 min)**

Address:
- **Next meeting**: Confirm date, time, location
- **Roles**: "We need a facilitator, timekeeper, and scribe. These rotate. I'll do it next week, but we should rotate starting soon."
- **Documentation**: "We'll track attendance and reflections simply. I'll set up a basic system and share."
- **Questions**: Open for brief practical questions

**4. Closing Gesture**

> "Let's close with a brief bow or moment of acknowledgment."

A simple bow or silent pause together.

---

## Phase 4: Establishing the Circle (Weeks 2-12)

### Week 2-4: Clarifying Structure

**Second Session**:
- Follow the same structure
- Begin discussing **role rotation**: Who will facilitate next?
- Start **attendance tracking**: Simple log of who attended
- Create a **communication channel**: Email list, Signal group, or similar

**Third Session**:
- First **role rotation**: New person facilitates, someone else keeps time
- Review the [Manifesto](../../index.md) together briefly (10 min before or after practice)
- Discuss: "Is this structure working? What needs adjustment?"

**Fourth Session**:
- Establish **decision-making process**: Read [Decision Meeting Protocol](decision_making.md) together
- Begin **documentation**: Decide how to store reflections and attendance (shared folder, notebook, etc.)

### Week 5-8: Deepening Commitment

**By now the circle should**:
- Have rotated facilitator role at least twice
- Have established clear communication method
- Have attendance tracking system
- Have basic documentation structure

**Check-in on**:
- Is everyone maintaining daily practice between sessions?
- Are people comfortable with the silence and structure?
- Are there any conflicts or unclear expectations?

**Consider**:
- Introducing **formal review of the Manifesto**: Does this document reflect our intention? Should we propose any adaptations?

### Week 9-12: Becoming Autonomous

**By the third month**:
- All roles (facilitator, scribe, treasurer if applicable) have rotated at least once
- Attendance patterns are clear (who's committed, who's uncertain)
- First **quarterly role rotation** is planned
- Circle has addressed any early conflicts or questions

**Key milestone**: Hold a **formal review meeting**:
- "Has the circle served our intention?"
- "Do we want to continue?"
- "Should we adjust anything based on experience?"
- "Are we ready to connect with the broader federation?"

---

## Phase 5: Connecting and Contributing

### Joining the Federation

Once your circle is stable (typically after 3 months):

**1. Announce your circle** (optional but recommended):
- Open a GitHub issue on the repository: "New Circle Formed — [Location/Name]"
- Share:
  - How long you've been meeting
  - Number of members
  - Format (in-person, online, etc.)
  - Any early learnings or adaptations
- No obligation to share private details, just let others know you exist

**2. Request repository access** (if interested):
- Circles are invited to participate in governance
- See [How We Change](HOW_WE_CHANGE.md) for process
- One or more members from your circle can become reviewers/contributors

**3. Share learnings**:
- What worked in your founding process?
- What would you do differently?
- What questions remain?

### Supporting Future Circles

As your circle matures, consider:
- Offering to mentor new circles in your area
- Hosting an **Open Ad Hoc Session** for people to try the practice
- Contributing to documentation improvements
- Participating in peer review of proposed changes

## Common Questions

### "What if we can't find 6 people?"

- Start with **Solo Practice** and invite people as you meet them
- Try an **Online Ad Hoc Circle** with lower commitment threshold
- Attend or start a **drop-in group** first to build relationships
- 6 is ideal for stability, but 4-5 can work initially

### "What if someone wants to leave after a few weeks?"

From the [Conflict Resolution guide](conflict_resolution.md):
> "Members may leave at any time without stigma or penalty. Leaving is part of growth — freedom is the safeguard of integrity."

- Normalize leaving as acceptable
- Ask if they'd share feedback (but don't pressure)
- Adjust if membership drops below 6 (invite new people or merge with another circle)

### "What if there's a conflict?"

Follow the [Conflict Resolution guide](conflict_resolution.md):
1. Address within the circle through open dialogue
2. If unresolved, mediation by two members from other circles
3. Leaving is always an accepted outcome

**Early on**: Conflicts often arise from unclear expectations. Revisit the Manifesto together.

### "What if we want to change the structure?"

From [How We Change](evolution.md):
- Small tweaks (timing, location): Decide internally
- Structural changes: Test as an experiment, document results
- Core principle changes: Requires testing, formal review, and federation input

**Remember**: One adaptation at a time, never compromising existing principles.

### "Do we need to use GitHub or technology?"

**Minimum**: No. You can run a circle with just:
- A space
- A timer
- A notebook
- Email or phone for communication

**Recommended**: Basic documentation helps with:
- Tracking attendance and patterns
- Recording anonymized reflections
- Sharing learnings with future circles

**Full participation**: Contributing to the federation and governance requires GitHub access, but many resources exist to help non-technical members learn.

### "Can we start without reading everything?"

**Minimum required**:
- [Manifesto](../../index.md)
- [Standing Meditation Introduction](../practice/standing_meditation/0_intro.md)

**Recommended within first month**:
- [How We Change](evolution.md)
- [Decision Meeting Protocol](decision_making.md)

**Over time**:
- Practice stages (Foundation through Integration)
- Appendices and traditions

You don't need to master everything before starting. Circles learn as they practice.

## Closing Thoughts

**You don't need to get everything perfect.** The practice is about learning through doing, not perfecting before starting.

**You're not alone.** If other circles exist, reach out. If not, you're pioneering — and others will follow.

**The documents serve the practice, not the reverse.** If something in this guide doesn't serve your circle's intention, propose a change. That's how we evolve together.

**Welcome.** Thank you for taking this step. May your circle support clarity, honesty, and compassion in ordinary life.
