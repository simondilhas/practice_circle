# Financial Guidelines  
> Money supports practice — it should flow where it sustains attention, inclusion, and evolution.

## 1. Structure

Each circle manages its own **shared ledger** — shared spreadsheet, later on the app.  
The format is common across circles, but management is local and transparent.

**Ledger columns:**
- Date  
- Description  
- Income / Expense  
- Category (see below)  
- Balance  
- Responsible person  

All members must have read access.

## 2. Recommended Budget Distribution

| Category | Purpose | Recommended Share |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Location & Circle Development** | Space rental, utilities, supplies, shared meals, materials, books, or small experiments that strengthen the circle | 20% |
| **Support Fund** | Inclusion support for members in need (fees, access, travel) | 10% |
| **Cross-Circle Contribution** | Shared federation work, documentation, research, outreach, or communication tools | 25% |
| **Reserve** | Buffer for future needs, emergencies, or equipment | 25% |
| **Discretionary / Experimental** | Trial formats, creative projects| 20% |

Percentages are **guidelines**, not rules.  
Each circle adjusts according to context, size, and local costs — while maintaining **transparency, fairness, and sustainability**.

## 3. Principles

1. **Transparency replaces control** — all members can see where money flows.  
2. **Sufficiency over accumulation** — keep enough for continuity, not excess.  
3. **Inclusion before perfection** — ensure everyone can participate, regardless of means.  
4. **Shared responsibility** — treasurer role rotates; no one “owns” the funds.  
5. **Alignment with purpose** — every expense must serve practice or structure, never prestige.

## 4. Federation Coordination

- Each circle submits a **quarterly summary** to the federation treasurer (rotating role).  
- The federation aggregates summaries into a shared overview accessible to all circles.  
- Surpluses may be used to:
  - Seed new circles  
  - Fund inter-circle work or events  
  - Support research and documentation  
  - Provide inclusion grants for new members

> When money circulates transparently, it builds trust instead of power.  
> Visibility is enough; control is unnecessary.
