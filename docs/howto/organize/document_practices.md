# Documentation Guide — Recording Practice and Progress

## Purpose

Documentation transforms individual experience into collective knowledge.  
It enables pattern recognition, validates methods, and holds the Circle accountable to its principles.

This guide explains **what to document, how to document it, and how to use the tools** that support the practice.

> Documentation is not bureaucracy. It is attention made visible.

## The Documentation App

The Practice Circle provides a web app for documenting practice:

**[https://practice-circle.softr.app](https://practice-circle.softr.app)**

### Features
- **Add to home screen** — works like a native app on mobile devices
- **Daily practice logs** — record sessions with observations and context
- **Session reflections** — document circle meetings and insights
- **Progress tracking** — view patterns over time
- **Privacy-first** — your data remains yours; sharing is voluntary
- **Offline-capable** — log even without internet connection

### Getting Started
1. Visit [https://practice-circle.softr.app](https://practice-circle.softr.app)
2. Create an account (email or anonymous ID)
3. On mobile: tap "Add to Home Screen" for quick access
4. Start logging your practice

The app is a **minimum viable product (MVP)** — a starting point, not a finished system.  
Features will evolve based on what practitioners actually need.

## What to Document

### 1. Daily Personal Practice

**After each solo practice session**, log:

#### Core Observations
- **Duration** — how long you practiced
- **Form** — standing, sitting, walking, other
- **Physical sensations** — tension, warmth, trembling, stability
- **Breath changes** — faster, slower, deeper, irregular
- **Mental state** — restless, calm, distracted, focused
- **Challenges** — what was difficult

#### Context (Optional but Valuable)
- Sleep quality the night before
- Stress level (work, relationships, health)
- Time of day
- Recent meals, caffeine, alcohol
- Physical activity before practice
- Weather (if relevant)

**Record observations, not interpretations.**

✓ Good: "Shoulders relaxed after 10 minutes; breath slowed naturally"  
✗ Avoid: "Energy flowed through my meridians"

---

### 2. Circle Session Reflections

**After each group practice**, document:

#### Individual Reflection
- What did I notice during practice?
- What challenged me?
- What intention arises for the week?

These are written during the **Closing** segment of each session (see [Practice Formats](../practice/practice_formats.md)).

Sharing reflections with the group is optional.  
Logging them for yourself is essential.

#### Circle Records (Scribe Role)
- **Attendance** — who was present
- **Session structure** — any variations from standard format
- **Group observations** — patterns, challenges, energy shifts
- **Administrative notes** — schedule changes, role rotations

Circle records are shared within the circle, anonymized if published externally.

---

### 3. Extended Reflections

**Weekly or monthly**, review your logs and note:

- **Patterns across sessions** — recurring sensations, improvements, struggles
- **Life changes outside practice** — mood, sleep, stress response, relationships
- **Questions or curiosities** — what are you wondering about?
- **Adjustments made** — changes to posture, duration, timing, and their effects

This meta-reflection reveals what daily logs alone cannot show.

---

### 4. Milestone Summaries

**Every 3-6 months**, assess deeper changes:

#### Physical
- Posture, flexibility, pain levels, balance, strength

#### Physiological
- Sleep quality, digestion, energy, stress response

#### Mental
- Focus, impulse control, emotional regulation, mental clarity

#### Relational
- Communication quality, conflict handling, presence with others

**Be specific.**  
"I feel more centered" is less useful than "I pause before reacting in conflicts."

These summaries may be shared (anonymously or attributed) to help others understand realistic timelines and common patterns.

---

## Personal Context and History

The app allows (voluntary) logging of background information to identify patterns across practitioners:

### Demographic Context
- Town
- Country
- Place of birth
- Birth month and year

### Health Context
- Known health issues
- Physical limitations or adaptations
- Additional health data (anonymized before upload)

**All personal data is:**
- Voluntary — share only what feels appropriate
- Private by default — you control what gets shared
- Anonymized if used for collective analysis
- Stored securely and linked to your account

This data helps answer questions like:
- Do older practitioners progress differently?
- How does chronic pain affect practice patterns?
- Are there regional or cultural variations in experience?

---

## How to Document Well

### Observation Over Interpretation

Record what you **directly sense**, not what you think it means.

**Physical sensations:**  
Describe tension, warmth, pressure, trembling, stillness, lightness, heaviness.

**Breath:**  
Note rhythm (fast/slow), depth (shallow/deep), effort (forced/natural).

**Mental state:**  
Describe restlessness, calm, distraction, clarity — without judgment.

**Emotions:**  
Name what arises (anxiety, frustration, contentment) without attaching stories.

### Honesty Over Performance

This is not about proving practice "works."  
**Struggle, stagnation, and regression are valuable data.**

- If practice feels pointless for two weeks — log that
- If old tensions return — log that
- If you skip sessions — log that (and note why)

Collective knowledge depends on seeing the full picture, not just highlights.

### Specificity Over Generalization

Vague claims obscure useful patterns.

✗ "Practice was good today"  
✓ "Stood 25 minutes; legs stable; mind wandered less than usual"

✗ "Feeling more balanced lately"  
✓ "Haven't snapped at colleagues this week; noticed pause before reacting"

## Using the App

### Daily Logging Workflow

1. **After practice, open the app**
2. **Log the session:**
   - Duration and form
   - 2-3 key observations
   - Context if relevant (sleep, stress, etc.)
3. **Save** — takes 1-2 minutes

**Don't overthink it.** Brief, honest notes are better than detailed performative ones.

### Weekly Review

1. **View your last 7 days of logs**
2. **Look for patterns:**
   - What improved?
   - What stayed difficult?
   - What changed in your life?
3. **Write a brief summary** (optional but recommended)

### Monthly Deep Dive

1. **Review 4 weeks of practice**
2. **Note milestone shifts** in body, mind, or life
3. **Adjust practice if needed** — stage progression, duration, posture
4. **Share insights** with your circle or the broader community (if you wish)

---

## Privacy and Data Sharing

### Your Data Belongs to You

- **You decide what to share** — logs are private by default
- **Anonymization is standard** — personal identifiers removed before collective analysis
- **Consent is required** — nothing is shared publicly without your approval
- **Deletion is your right** — you can remove your data at any time

### Sharing for Collective Learning

If you choose to share logs for research or pattern recognition:

1. **Anonymize personal details** — remove names, locations, specific dates
2. **Keep observations intact** — raw data is most valuable
3. **Note unique context** — injury recovery, chronic conditions, etc.
4. **Submit through approved channels** — app export or pull request to documentation

Shared data helps the community understand:
- Common timelines and challenges
- Individual variation across age, health, experience
- What methods work for whom, under what conditions

**This is entirely voluntary.**  
Your practice is yours first. Contribution is appreciated, never required.

---

## Circle-Level Documentation

### Scribe Responsibilities (In-Person Fixed Circles)

The **Scribe** maintains circle records:

1. **Attendance log** — who attended each session
2. **Session notes** — structure, variations, group observations
3. **Administrative records** — role rotations, membership changes, decisions
4. **Anonymized reflections** — themes from closing reflections (if circle agrees)

Records are:
- Transparent to all circle members
- Stored securely (app or shared drive)
- Anonymized if shared beyond the circle

### Governance Documentation

All decisions, proposals, and changes are documented:

- **Decision logs** — what was decided, by whom, when
- **Change proposals** — experimental modifications and their results
- **Review summaries** — outcomes of testing periods
- **Amendment history** — how documents evolved over time

See [HOW_WE_CHANGE.md](HOW_WE_CHANGE.md) for the full process.

---

## Questionnaires and Structured Feedback

Periodically, the Circle may introduce **optional questionnaires** to gather structured data:

- Practice quality assessments
- Progression markers (by stage)
- Health and well-being indicators
- Community engagement patterns

These help identify patterns that emerge across many practitioners.

**Questionnaires are:**
- Voluntary — skip any question
- Anonymous by default — unless you choose attribution
- Designed with practitioners — questions evolve based on what's actually useful

---

## Standards for Collective Learning

### Testing Changes

When someone proposes a modification (posture, duration, new technique):

1. **Test it yourself first** — minimum 2-4 weeks
2. **Document observations** — what changed, what stayed the same
3. **Share findings** — data and reflection, not just opinion
4. **Others test independently** — does the pattern hold?
5. **Evaluate collectively** — if benefit appears consistently, integrate; otherwise refine or discard

**One change at a time.**  
Alter only one variable so you know what actually made a difference.

### Peer Review of Claims

If someone makes a strong claim ("this posture fixes back pain"):

- How many sessions did you observe this?
- Did other variables change?
- Has anyone else tested it?
- What are the limitations of your experience?

This is **collective honesty**, not skepticism.  
We refine understanding by questioning gently and testing rigorously.

---

## Ethical Guidelines

### No Medical Claims

We observe changes in our own bodies.  
**We do not diagnose, prescribe, or claim to treat illness.**

If practice improves your sleep, mood, or pain — that's your experience, not medical advice.  
Practitioners with health conditions should consult professionals.

### Intellectual Humility

We don't know everything this practice can do.  
We are building understanding step by step, grounded in observation.

Some experiences will be hard to explain.  
**Mystery doesn't require mystification.**

### Respect for Others' Experience

- Don't dismiss someone's observations because they differ from yours
- Don't impose interpretations on others' sensations
- Share your experience; don't prescribe it as truth

Different bodies, different lives, different patterns.  
That's the point of collective documentation.

---

## Contributing to Collective Knowledge

**Your logs — successes, struggles, questions — are the raw material of evolution.**

To contribute:
- Keep consistent logs (even brief ones)
- Share reflections when comfortable
- Question claims (including your own)
- Test proposed changes before endorsing them
- Document process, not just results

**The goal is not to prove practice is universal.**  
The goal is to understand **what it does, for whom, under what conditions** — honestly and rigorously.

---

## Tools, Not Oracles

The app and any future data systems **serve attention; they do not define it.**

- Use tools to support reflection, not replace it
- Algorithms may suggest patterns; humans interpret meaning
- Transparency in tool use is required
- All decisions remain human and procedural

Technology amplifies our capacity to observe.  
It does not determine what we see.
