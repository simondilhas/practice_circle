# Documentation Guide — Recording Practice and Progress

## Purpose

Documentation transforms individual experience into collective knowledge.  
It enables pattern recognition, validates methods, and holds the Circle accountable to its principles.

This guide explains **what to document, how to document it, and how to use the tools** that support the practice.

> Documentation is not bureaucracy. It is attention made visible.

**To add a record:**
1. Tap the orange "Add record" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Activities Performed**: Select your practice type (e.g., Standing Meditation)
   - **Context**: Describe what you noticed (physical sensations, mental state)
   - **Observed Effects**: Note any changes or insights
   - **Duration in Minutes**: How long you practiced
3. Tap "Add" to save

Remember: Record observations, not interpretations.

#### 4. Track Your Progress

View your practice patterns over time on the Dashboard:

### App Philosophy

The app is a **minimum viable product (MVP)** — a starting point, not a finished system.  
Features will evolve based on what practitioners actually need.

**Current Limitations:**
- Basic analytics only
- Limited social features
- Simple text-based logs

**Future Development:**
- Self-hosted database / migrate away from low-code platform
- Better user interface and user experience
- Native Android and iOS apps
- Voice notes for quick logging
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Facilitator-specific functionality (session planning, member management)
- Treasurer functionality (expense tracking, contribution management)
- Circle-specific shared insights
- Integration with wearable devices

Your feedback shapes the tool. Report issues or suggest features through the GitHub repository.

## What to Document

### Daily Personal Practice

**After each solo practice session**, log:

#### Core Observations
- **Duration** — how long you practiced
- **Form** — standing, sitting, walking, other
- **Physical sensations** — tension, warmth, trembling, stability
- **Breath changes** — faster, slower, deeper, irregular
- **Mental state** — restless, calm, distracted, focused
- **Challenges** — what was difficult

#### Context (Optional but Valuable)
- Sleep quality the night before
- Stress level (work, relationships, health)
- Time of day
- Recent meals, caffeine, alcohol
- Physical activity before practice
- Weather (if relevant)

**Record observations, not interpretations.**

✓ Good: "Shoulders relaxed after 10 minutes; breath slowed naturally"  
✗ Avoid: "Energy flowed through my meridians"
