# Spread the Practice

The Practice Circle grows through genuine invitation, not aggressive marketing.  
When the practice helps you, sharing it becomes natural — not a duty, but an expression of care.

## Why Share?

Small groups practicing together create clarity, balance, and depth that's rare in modern life.  
When you've experienced this, you might want others to have the same opportunity.

**Sharing the practice means:**
- Inviting people you care about to experience something meaningful
- Supporting others who want to start their own circles
- Making the framework available without imposing it

This isn't about recruitment — it's about **making the door visible** to those who might be looking for it.

## 1. Share the Vision

### Use the Flyers

We've created simple, printable flyers you can share:

<div class="info-cards-container">

<div class="info-card">
<h3>STOP Flyer (PDF)</h3>
<p>Print and post where people pause and reflect.</p>
<p><a href="/practice_circle/assets/flyers/STOP.pdf" download>Download PDF →</a></p>
</div>

<div class="info-card">
<h3>STOP Flyer (PNG)</h3>
<p>Share digitally or print in high quality.</p>
<p><a href="/practice_circle/assets/flyers/stop-1.png" download>Download Image →</a></p>
</div>

</div>

**Where to share:**
- Coffee shops, libraries, community centers
- University bulletin boards
- Yoga studios, meditation spaces
- Your workplace (if appropriate)

## 2. Invite Someone Personally

### The Postcard Approach

Sometimes the most powerful invitation is personal and physical.

**Download the [Practice Circle Postcard](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG1r-_0yEk/D-JzeWIXGkw9MK9sEsKKrQ/edit)**  
Write a few lines by hand. Send it by real mail.

**Who to invite:**
- Friends who seem exhausted by modern life's pace
- Colleagues interested in mindfulness or reflection
- Anyone seeking meaning beyond conventional religion
- People who value community without hierarchy

**What to say:**
Keep it simple and honest:
- "I've been practicing with a small group and it's been meaningful..."
- "This might interest you if you're looking for..."
- "No pressure — just thought you'd want to know this exists"

## 3. Start New Circles

### When Your Circle Grows

When a circle reaches about 10 people, it's time to consider splitting into two circles.  
This keeps groups intimate enough for real dialogue and shared presence.

**Ready to start a new circle?**  
Follow the [Circle Creation Guide](organize/lifecycle/create_a_circle.md)

### Geographic Expansion

If you're in a new city or region:
- Check if circles already exist in your area (via the [app](https://practice-circle.softr.app))
- If not, you can be the first
- Use the [Starter Kit](organize/lifecycle/create_a_circle.md) to set up structure

## 4. Support Other Circles

### Become a Facilitator

Help new circles get started by learning facilitation:
- Read the [Facilitator Guide](organize/roles/facilitator.md)
- Experience facilitating in your own circle first
- Offer to support a new circle's first sessions

### Mentor New Circles

Once your circle has practiced together for several months:
- Share documentation and learnings
- Answer questions from emerging circles
- Contribute to the shared knowledge base

### Cross-Circle Learning

- Attend sessions at other circles occasionally
- Share practices that worked well for your group
- Stay connected through the Practice Circle network

## Principles of Spreading

**1. Invitation, not persuasion**  
People find this when they're ready. Make it visible, don't push.

**2. Share from experience**  
Only recommend what you've practiced yourself. Authenticity matters.

**3. Keep the door open**  
Some people will be curious but not ready. That's fine. The practice will be here when they need it.

**4. Maintain quality over quantity**  
One circle practicing with depth matters more than ten circles rushing through motions.

**5. Stay transparent**  
Share both what works and what's difficult. Honesty builds trust.

## Questions?

**"How do I know if someone would be interested?"**  
You don't. Just make them aware it exists. They'll decide.

**"What if I invite someone and they think it's weird?"**  
That's okay. Not everyone will resonate. Share it with those who might appreciate it, and let go of the outcome.

**"Should I try to grow my circle quickly?"**  
No. Slow, organic growth creates stronger foundations. Quality of practice > speed of expansion.

**"Can I modify the materials?"**  
Yes! Adapt flyers, postcards, or explanations to fit your context. Just maintain the core principles.

The practice spreads naturally when it genuinely helps people.  
Focus on your own circle's depth, and the network will grow at the right pace.
