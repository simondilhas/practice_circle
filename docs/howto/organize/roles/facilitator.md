# How to be a Facilitator  
> Holds the frame so others can hold attention.

---

## Purpose

The facilitator maintains structure and rhythm during sessions — starting and ending on time, guiding transitions, and protecting the atmosphere of shared attention.  

The facilitator is **not a teacher or leader**.  
Their function is to protect the integrity of the practice session: time, rhythm, safety, and respect.

Facilitation is a **rotating duty**, not a status.  
Anyone with basic experience in the Circle's method can serve.

They do not teach or interpret. Their authority is procedural, not personal.

> The facilitator holds the frame so others can hold attention.

## Duties

- Prepare the physical or digital space  
- Open and close with silence

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Prepare the space
- Ensure the room is clean, quiet, and neutral (no symbolic objects or music).
- Check lighting and temperature.
- Arrange enough space for safe standing with arms extended.

### 2. Open the session
- Start on time.  
- Invite each participant to say one line:  
  "My name is … Today I'm here for …"
- Remind everyone of duration, silence, and right to rest if needed.

### 3. Keep time
- Maintain 40 minutes of standing meditation (or agreed duration).
- Use a neutral timer sound (no gong apps with "spiritual" branding).
- Signal start and end with one calm tone or phrase: "We begin." / "We close."

### 4. Ensure safety
- Observe participants discreetly.
- If someone sways, trembles, or looks distressed, approach quietly:
  - Lightly guide them to sit or rest.
  - Offer water and grounding (simple conversation or walking).
- Stop the whole session only if absolutely necessary.

### 5. Close the session
- Invite everyone to sit or stand relaxed.
- Offer 2–3 minutes of silent transition.
- Read a short closing line or quote if desired.
- Invite documentation: written reflection or digital log.

### 6. Record keeping
- Note date, duration, attendance (first names only), and any incidents.
- Upload to the shared ledger or group folder the same day.

## What the Facilitator Does *Not* Do

- Interpret experiences ("That warmth means energy moving")  
- Correct posture unless someone risks injury  
- Offer therapy or spiritual advice  
- Dominate debrief discussions  
- Lead beyond agreed structure

> Silence teaches; words can confuse.

---

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Physical distress
- Ask quietly: "Would you like to sit or step outside?"
- Never physically adjust without consent.
- If fainting or strong dizziness occurs:
  1. Support them to sit or lie flat.
  2. Elevate legs slightly if safe.
  3. Offer water, ventilation.
  4. Call emergency services if unresponsive or unsure.
  5. Document the incident immediately.

### Emotional release
- Treat crying, shaking, or tension as natural discharge — not a problem.
- Maintain calm presence, avoid analysis.
- After session, offer short grounding talk or suggest rest.

### Conflict or disruption
- If someone speaks or moves repeatedly:
  - Quietly remind: "Please return to silence."
  - If persistent, invite them to step out until ready.
- Document any conflict for peer review.

## Ethical Ground

1. **Confidentiality**
   - Personal stories shared in debrief stay private.  
   - Only practical feedback is recorded publicly.

2. **Neutrality**
   - Facilitator's opinions, politics, and beliefs stay outside the session.

3. **Rotation**
   - Each Circle member should facilitate at least once per cycle.
   - If a person resists facilitation repeatedly, discuss in reflection meeting.

4. **Humility**
   - Facilitation is service, not mastery.  
   - When unsure, return to basics: silence, posture, awareness.

---

## Optional Variations

- **Co-facilitation:** two people share duties (one times, one observes).
- **Remote sessions:** host via Zoom with cameras optional; same structure.
- **Outdoor practice:** adapt to weather and terrain, maintain quiet.

---

## Reflection After Each Session

Facilitators should answer for themselves:
- Did everyone feel safe and included?  
- Was silence preserved?  
- Did I intervene only when necessary?  
- What could improve next time?

Upload short notes (2–3 sentences) to the session log.

## In Case of Serious Incidents

If any event requires medical, psychological, or legal attention:
1. Contact emergency services if needed.
2. Notify two other circles for peer mediation.
3. File a confidential incident report (template provided in Appendix).
4. Review process, not person, in next meeting.

> Transparency prevents escalation.  
> Compassion, not secrecy, maintains trust.

---

## Rotation & Integrity

Facilitators rotate every 3–6 months.  

Good facilitation disappears into the structure — when the circle forgets there was one, the session worked.

> The facilitator's success is measured by absence —  
> when the group forgets there was a facilitator at all.

Standing meditation teaches self-regulation.  
The facilitator's task is simply to make that possible, safely and consistently.
