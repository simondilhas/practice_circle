# Be a Treasurer  
> Keeps resources visible so trust can stay invisible.

## Purpose
The treasurer manages the circle’s shared finances — ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness.  
Money supports the practice but never defines it.

## Duties
- Maintain clear records of all income and expenses  
- Collect contributions and pay shared costs  
- Share monthly or quarterly balance sheets with all members  
- Ensure no one is excluded for financial reasons  
- Support sliding scale and fairness principles

## Rotation & Integrity
Rotate every 3–6 months.  
Transparency replaces control — every member should understand the circle’s financial situation at any time.
