# Organizing a Practice Circle

These guides explain how to create, maintain, and evolve a Practice Circle as a collective — ensuring shared responsibility, transparent decision-making, and adaptive structures.

## Core Organizational Guides

- **[Decision Making](decision_making.md)** — How to reach collective decisions through structured protocols
- **[Documentation](documentation.md)** — How to document practice and make work visible for collective learning
- **[Creating a Circle](creating_a_circle.md)** — How to establish a new Practice Circle
- **[Evolution](evolution.md)** — How the circle adapts, changes, and maintains integrity over time
- **[Conflict Resolution](conflict_resolution.md)** — How to address conflicts through dialogue and mediation

## Principles

Authority is procedural, not personal. Clarity and documentation hold power, not individuals.

By sharing decisions, accountability, and information, we prevent hierarchy, preserve trust, and ensure that the circle continues even when members change.
