# Organizing a Practice Circle

These guides explain how to create, maintain, and evolve a Practice Circle as a collective — ensuring shared responsibility, transparent decision-making, and adaptive structures.

## Circle Roles

These rotating responsibilities ensure shared leadership and prevent hierarchy:

- **[Facilitator](roles/facilitator.md)** — How to hold the frame so others can hold attention
- **[Scribe](roles/scribe.md)** — How to make collective learning visible through documentation
- **[Treasurer](roles/treasurer.md)** — How to keep resources visible so trust can stay invisible

## Circle Lifecycle

Guides for establishing, maintaining, and evolving your circle:

- **[Create a Circle](lifecycle/create_a_circle.md)** — How to establish a new Practice Circle
- **[Evolve the Circle](lifecycle/evolve_the_circle.md)** — How the circle adapts, changes, and maintains integrity over time
- **[Document Practices](lifecycle/document_practices.md)** — How to document practice and make work visible for collective learning

## Protocols & Processes

Structured approaches to collective decision-making and support:

- **[Make Decisions](protocols/make_decisions.md)** — How to reach collective decisions through structured protocols
- **[Resolve Conflicts](protocols/resolve_conflicts.md)** — How to address conflicts through dialogue and mediation
- **[Mentor Members](protocols/mentor_members.md)** — How to provide mentorship and support to circle members
- **[Use LLM Assistance](protocols/use_llm_assistance.md)** — How to use language models for documentation support

## Financial Management

Transparent financial practices for circles and federation:

- **[Circle Finances](finances/circle_finances.md)** — How individual circles manage shared resources
- **[Federation Finances](finances/federation_finances.md)** — How the federation manages collective infrastructure

## Principles

Authority is procedural, not personal. Clarity and documentation hold power, not individuals.

By sharing decisions, accountability, and information, we prevent hierarchy, preserve trust, and ensure that the circle continues even when members change.
