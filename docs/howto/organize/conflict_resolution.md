# Conflict Resolution Protocol

## Purpose

Conflict is natural in any collective work. This protocol ensures conflicts are addressed with honesty, clarity, and respect — protecting trust and preventing corruption of the circle's integrity.

## Commitment

When conflict arises, I address it directly and with honesty.  
I seek understanding before judgment, clarity before reaction.  
If resolution cannot be found within the circle, I support mediation by two peers from other circles.  
Mediation seeks clarity, not victory.  
Leaving is always an honorable option — freedom safeguards integrity.

## Process

### 1. Direct Dialogue
- Address conflicts directly with the person involved
- Speak with honesty and listen with openness
- Seek to understand before seeking to be understood
- Focus on the issue, not the person

### 2. Circle-Level Discussion
If direct dialogue does not resolve the conflict:
- Bring the matter to the circle for collective reflection
- All parties present their perspective
- The circle seeks clarity on the underlying issues
- Solutions are explored collectively

### 3. External Mediation
If circle discussion does not achieve resolution:
- Request mediation from two peers from other Practice Circles
- Mediators listen to all perspectives
- Mediators help clarify the core issues
- Mediators may offer observations but do not impose decisions
- The goal is clarity and understanding, not victory

### 4. Honorable Exit
If resolution remains impossible:
- Any member may choose to leave the circle
- Leaving is recognized as an honorable option
- Freedom protects both individual integrity and circle integrity
- No shame or blame accompanies departure

## Principles

**Clarity Over Harmony**  
False peace harms more than honest conflict. We seek real understanding, not surface agreement.

**Process Over Power**  
Conflict resolution follows agreed procedures, not personal influence.

**Freedom Protects Integrity**  
The option to leave preserves both individual autonomy and collective health.

**Mediation Seeks Understanding**  
External mediators clarify; they do not judge or impose.

*Conflict, addressed with honesty and process, strengthens trust. Conflict avoided or suppressed corrupts it.*
