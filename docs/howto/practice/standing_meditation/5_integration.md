# Standing Practice – Stage 5  
**Integration: Standing in Life**

---

### Purpose
To dissolve the boundary between formal practice and daily activity.  
Stillness, balance, and clarity now express themselves naturally in movement, conversation, and decision-making.

---

### Principle
- No posture, no session — only awareness.  
- The same grounded presence from standing now informs walking, speaking, working, listening.  
- Practice is not about adding time but *removing gaps* in attention.

---

### Everyday Applications
#### Walking
- Feel weight transfer as a continuation of Stage 4 micro-shifts.  
- Land softly, push lightly — feet roll, spine stays buoyant.  
- Every step is a return to balance.

#### Working
- Before tasks, pause one breath; reconnect to body contact (feet on floor, seat on chair).  
- During stress, note tension in shoulders or jaw — release it, continue.

#### Communication
- Listen through the body, not just ears.  
- Maintain steady breathing while others speak.  
- Stillness here becomes empathy.

#### Rest and Recovery
- A few minutes of quiet standing between activities resets the nervous system.  
- Awareness is continuous, but effort alternates with rest.

---

### Mental Focus
- Awareness expands beyond body boundaries — to environment, people, tasks.  
- Mind notices reactions in real time but does not chase them.  
- The aim is *responsive stillness*, not neutrality.

### Eyes
- Eyes naturally **open** in daily life.  
- The soft, unfocused gaze from Stage 3 becomes your default way of seeing.  
- You see clearly without grasping at details; observe without getting lost in thought.  
- Vision integrates with whole-body awareness rather than dominating attention.

> Presence without rigidity.  Movement without distraction.

---

### Periodic Calibration
- Keep at least one formal standing session per week to maintain reference.  
- Record brief notes on how the quality of awareness appears in daily life.  
- Use the circle’s group sessions for reflection and alignment, not instruction.

---

### Signs of Maturity
- Tension resolves spontaneously during stress.  
- Emotional charge subsides quickly.  
- Grounded calm available anytime.  
- Practice no longer feels like practice.

### Common Errors
| Issue | Correction |
|--------|------------|
| Forgetting formal practice | Keep weekly calibration |
| Turning awareness into stiffness | Stay physically relaxed |
| Using mindfulness to avoid engagement | Act fully, stay present |
| Seeking mystical experiences | Return to ordinary life |

---

### Goal
To live as you stand: clear, steady, responsive.  
The practice no longer occurs in a room — it occurs wherever you are.

> “The circle completes when stillness walks with you.”
