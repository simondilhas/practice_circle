# Standing Practice – Stage 2  
**Stabilisation: Building Strength and Coherence**

---

### Purpose
Develop internal alignment and resilient stillness.  
Transition from *relaxation under gravity* to *strength through relaxation.*

**Duration:** typically months 6–18, overlapping with Stage 1.

---

### Posture
- Deepen stance slightly; knees over feet (knee NOT over toes)
- Hips and shoulders level.  
- Hands lifted as if holding a wide ball at chest height.  
- Spine hangs from crown; tailbone releases downward.

---

### Focus
- Maintain softness while facing increasing internal pressure.  
- Tremors or shaking are adaptation — let them resolve naturally.  
- Do not chase sensations; maintain form.

---

### Breathing
- Allow breath to lengthen on its own.  
- Feel ribs expand through sides and back.  
- No counting or holding.

---

### Eyes
- Continue with **eyes open** as in Stage 1, lids slightly lowered, gaze soft.  
- As the stance deepens and arms rise, you may find **closed eyes** help you sense the increased internal load more clearly.  
- Experiment with both open and closed. Notice whether closed eyes deepen relaxation or create instability at this stage.

---

### Feet
- Now work toward **feet parallel**, pointing straight ahead.
- Keep the same distance — roughly shoulder-width apart.
- Balance weight evenly between balls and heels.
- Check that knees track over the middle of the feet; do not let them collapse inward.

---

### Arms
- After several weeks in Stage 2, when standing with arms down feels stable, begin to **lift arms slowly** — as if buoyed up by water or air.  
- Stop when hands are roughly at **lower chest or solar plexus height**, elbows rounded,  
  palms facing each other/body as though holding a large ball.  
- 5 to 20cm distance between hands; wrists stay soft.  
- Maintain only as long as relaxation remains.  
- If tension appears in shoulders or wrists, lower the arms and rest.

> Arms raised = Stage 2 core posture.  
> Do not attempt raised-arm positions until Stage 1 criteria are met.

---

### Mental Focus
- **Reduce visualization.** Keep awareness on physical sensations:
  - Contact of soles with floor.  
  - Subtle sway or vibration of the body.  
  - Expansion of breath through ribs and back.
- If the mind drifts, you may briefly recall earlier cues (roots, thread) to re-center, then release them again.  
- The aim is **direct sensing**, not imagining (stop your visualizations - listen to the body)

---
### Feeling Sensation and Connection

As tension dissolves and attention steadies, new sensations appear: warmth, vibration, tingling, subtle movement inside the body.  
Tradition calls this *qi*, but it can be understood directly — as the nervous system perceiving itself more clearly. This can be:

- **Warmth** 
- **Pulsing or vibration**
- **Flow or expansion**

These are not mystical forces to control but feedback from the body.  
The goal is not to chase them but to notice them calmly, without naming or interpreting.  

> When awareness deepens, the body speaks in sensation instead of thought.

#### How to relate to these sensations
1. **Acknowledge** what you feel — heat, buzzing, movement.  
2. **Stay neutral** — neither excited nor dismissive.  
3. **Return to structure** — posture, breath, and balance.  
4. **Let the experience fade naturally.**

With time, the distinction between “body” and “awareness” softens; feeling and knowing merge.  
This is the *mind–body connection* — a unified field of attention, not a force to manipulate.

#### Common misunderstanding
Chasing these sensations for proof of progress blocks the very relaxation that allows them.  
Trust the process: sensation is a side effect, not the goal.


---

### Routine
- 20–40 minutes per session, 4–5 times weekly.  
- End each session with laying down on your back (if possible) and listening to the body
- Document what you did and what it did to you — contribute to collective understanding.

---

### Signs of Progress
- Even warmth throughout body.  
- Calm clarity even under effort.  
- Upright, springy posture.

---

### Common Errors
| Issue | Correction |
|--------|------------|
| Collapsing hips or knees | Keep crown lifted and spine long |
| Holding tension | Revisit Stage 1 looseners |
| Over-breathing | Let breath find natural length |
| Mental strain | Shift attention to soles of feet |
| High energy, problems to sleep | Reduce time with raised hands, focus more on feet and belly |

---

### Goal
Elastic strength: firm but supple, rooted yet light.

---

### When to Explore Stage 3
When you can hold raised arms for 20+ minutes and the body feels restorative after practice rather than depleted — experiment with closing your eyes fully and sensing the whole body breathing as one.  
Play with the slow rotations. If internal awareness sharpens rather than scatters, Stage 3 is inviting you in.
