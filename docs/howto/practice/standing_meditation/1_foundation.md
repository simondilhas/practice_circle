# Standing Practice – Stage 1  
**Foundation: Clearing and Opening**

---

### Purpose
To free the body from tension and learn to stand without strain.

**Duration:** about 3–6 months.

---

### Posture
- Feet shoulder-width apart, knees soft, spine long.  
- Weight evenly on both feet.  
- Crown gently lifted, chin tucked slightly.  
- Shoulders loose, arms hanging naturally. 
- Experiment with rotating your palms to face inward toward your body or backward.

---

### Feet
- Start with the feet forming a **slight V-shape** — heels about a fist-width apart, toes angled outward 10–15°.
- This position allows hips and lower back to relax and opens the groin naturally.
- Weight rests toward the center of each foot, not on the heels.
- Feel the ball and outer edge of each foot gently pressing the floor.

---

### Arms
- Let arms hang naturally at the sides, fingers slightly curved.  
- Keep shoulders and chest relaxed; elbows drop with their own weight.  
- Sense a gentle lengthening through the fingertips, not a forced stretch.  
- **Arms remain lowered throughout Stage 1** — raised positions begin only in Stage 2.

> Simple hanging arms allow full attention on feet, spine, and breath.

---

### Breathing
- Breathe naturally through the nose.  
- Let breath settle in the lower abdomen without forcing.  
- On exhale, allow shoulders and back to soften.  
- Keep tongue on top of palate (roof of your mouth).

### Eyes
- **Eyes open**, lids slightly lowered, gaze soft and resting forward or downward.  
- Let visual input remain in the background — don't focus on specific objects.  
- **Experiment with closed eyes** if you find it easier to sense internal alignment and relaxation.  
- Some find closed eyes deepen the experience; others prefer open eyes for stability.  
- Test both and notice which supports clearer awareness for you.

---

### Mental Focus
- Use light **visualizations** to help attention settle:
  - Imagine roots growing gently from the soles into the ground.  
  - Feel a thread lifting from the crown, lengthening the spine.  
  - Picture breath moving like mist in and out of the lower abdomen.
  - Trace/scan your body from top to bottom and let the attention circle horizontally. The combination of the horizontal circle and the slow vertical downward movement build a spiral.
- These images are only **tools for sensing alignment**, not beliefs or energy rituals.  
- Drop them as soon as you can maintain posture and relaxation without them.

---

### Routine
- 10–20 minutes daily; short sessions better than one long hold.  
- Gentle shaking or joint rotations before and after.  
- Note sensations: warmth, trembling, relaxation.
- Document what you did and what it did to you — contribute to collective understanding.

---


### Signs of Progress
- Stable balance.
- Relaxation and better awareness of tension. 
- Breath deepens naturally.  
- Mind quiets.

### 5. Common Errors
| Issue | Correction |
|--------|------------|
| Locking knees | Keep soft bend |
| Tight shoulders | Exhale and drop weight |
| Forcing breath | Return to natural rhythm |
| Overtraining | Shorter, more frequent sessions |
| Getting attached to sensations | Note them, let them pass |

---

### Goal
Become aware of where you hold tension — and learn to let it dissolve.

### When to Explore Stage 2
When standing for 15+ minutes feels natural rather than effortful, and warmth appears in your legs without forcing — try lifting your arms into the ball position for a few minutes.  
If it feels curious rather than strained, Stage 2 is ready for you to explore.
