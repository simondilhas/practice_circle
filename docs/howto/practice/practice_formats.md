# Appendix: Practice Formats

This appendix provides detailed guidance for the three complementary practice formats recognized by the Practice Circles. Each format serves different needs, contexts, and levels of commitment while sharing the same core intention of training attention, honesty, and compassion.

---

The Practice Circle recognizes several complementary formats of meeting.  
Each serves a specific purpose — from individual practice to collective discernment.

---

## 1. Private Practice
The foundation of all other work.  
Each member maintains a **daily individual practice** — standing, sitting, walking, or another mindful form — to train attention and presence.  
Personal stability supports every group session.

---

## 2. Ad Hoc Circle
A **flexible, drop-in session** for shared practice and connection.  
Used for orientation, support, or maintaining rhythm between fixed circles.  
- Online or in-person  
- Open to all levels  
- Simple structure: check-in → silent practice → brief reflection  

No commitment, no hierarchy — only shared presence.

---

## 3. Permanent Circle
A **committed, recurring group** that meets weekly or biweekly.  
Its purpose is **depth, accountability, and collective refinement.**  
Members rotate roles (facilitator, scribe, treasurer) and document practice together.  
This is the primary container for steady, embodied development.

## 4. Review Circle (Internal Discernment)
A **periodic reflection meeting within a permanent circle**, held every 1–3 months.  
It pauses regular practice to review what has been learned and how the circle functions.

### Purpose
- Reflect on individual and collective progress  
- Review practice logs and documentation  
- Identify tensions or patterns in participation  
- Adjust rhythm, structure, or commitments as needed  

### Structure
- Short check-in  
- Review of notes and logs  
- Shared reflection and dialogue  
- Clarify next steps or changes  
- Document conclusions in the circle record  

> Reflection keeps the circle honest.  
> Regular review prevents drift and deepens trust.

## 5. Federation Discernment (Between Circles)
When multiple circles meet to **share experience, coordinate decisions, or refine the shared framework.**  
These meetings keep the federation connected without hierarchy.

### Purpose
- Exchange learning between circles  
- Discuss proposed framework revisions  
- Address inter-circle conflicts or mediation  
- Strengthen transparency and collective direction  

### Structure
- Opening silence and check-in  
- Reports or brief summaries from each circle  
- Shared discernment on key topics  
- Recording of outcomes and next steps  

> The federation coordinates through clarity, not control.  
> Decisions emerge from attention, not authority.

## 6. Circle Meeting Structure

All circle sessions — practice, review, or discernment — follow a shared rhythm.

### 1. Check-In (5–10 min)
Short silence to arrive, then brief statements of intention.

### 2. Practice (30–45 min)
Shared silent practice; facilitator keeps time and neutrality.

### 3. Documentation (10 min)
Each member notes personal observations; scribe records anonymized notes if relevant.

### 4. Sharing / Discussion (15–30 min)
Brief reflection round or discernment dialogue, depending on session type.

### 5. Closing (2–3 min)
Short silence; confirm documentation and next session.
