# How to Join a Practice Circle

There are two simple ways to begin:

---

## Option 1 — Register through the Practice Circle App

1. Go to [https://practice-circle.softr.app/login](https://practice-circle.softr.app/login) 
2. Create a short profile — just your name, email, and a few words about your interest.  
3. You can then:
   - **Join an existing circle** near you or online  
   - **Start a new circle** with the help of our [Starter Kit](../docs/howto/organize/lifecycle/create_a_circle.md)
   - **Connect** with others exploring similar practices

The app helps circles stay connected and share their learnings with the wider network.

## Option 2 — Contact Simon Directly

If you prefer a personal start, reach out to:

**Simon Dilhas**  
[simon.dilhas@gmail.com](mailto:simon.dilhas@simon.dilhas@gmail.com)

You can write in English or German.  
Simon can:
- Connect you with an existing circle  
- Help you form a new one  
- Answer questions about facilitation, structure, or documentation  

---

## What Happens After You Join

- You’ll receive a short **orientation email** with links to the Circle Starter Kit.  
- You’ll be invited to a **welcome session** (online) to meet others.  
- From there, you can start practicing, documenting, and co-creating.

> Every participant is a **co-creator** — there are no spectators here.  
> Circles grow through the people who take part.

## Still Unsure?

If you’re curious but not ready to commit, you can:
- Read the [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)  
- Or simply reach out to Simon for a short conversation.
