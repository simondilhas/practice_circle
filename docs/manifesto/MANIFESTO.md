# Cultivation Circle Manifesto

We meet regularly to train attention, honesty, and compassion so we act with clarity in the world.

## Why We Exist

Modern western life excels at the outer tasks, building, producing, optimizing, yet neglects the inner ones: seeing clearly, feeling deeply, acting with integrity. We are surrounded by information but short on wisdom; connected to everyone yet disconnected from ourselves.

Old religions once offered a framework for society, community and reflection but they come with dogma and hierarchy. Religion built a cache around spirituality and now they can't help us in our modern world. Going back to a religious framework, corrupted by excess and worldly powerplays is no option.

But having no framework for spirituality leaves us weak and without a clear path of progression. The modern world discarded those structures, and kept nothing to replace them. The result is that individuals search, stumble from trend to trend but can't progress. Or fall for charismatic leadership.

We exist to restore the balance between the outer and inner worlds — not through belief, but through daily practice.

- **Attention** grounds us in presence without distraction.
- **Honesty** lets us see reality as it is, not as we wish it to be.
- **Curiosity** keeps us questioning and guards against dogma.
- **Humility** dissolves ego and makes shared leadership possible.
- **Compassion** reminds us that strength without care is just hardness.

Together, these principles form a path of continual practice, a way to live with clarity, integrity, and humanity in a noisy world.

To give this inner practice a fitting organizational framework that is ready to grow healthy we came up with these guardrails:

---

## 1. No Dogma — Everything Is Provisional

Nothing is "revealed truth." Every idea, method, or insight is a working hypothesis. If it can't be questioned or tested in experience, it's out.

→ Truth is a verb, not a possession.

---

## 2. Nobody Above the Framework

The structure outlives and overrides any personality. All roles rotate; leadership has term limits; documents are public.

→ Authority is procedural, not personal.

---

## 3. Shared Practice, Not Shared Belief

Membership requires participation, not belief. You don't have to agree, only to show up and practice with honesty.

→ Behavior over belief.

---

## 4. Open Books, Open Doors

Finances, decisions, curricula, and complaints are transparent. Any member can inspect records or attend governance meetings.

→ Secrecy only for personal confidentiality, never for power.

---

## 5. Local Autonomy, Global Accountability

Small circles of 10 self-govern but adhere to a short charter of ethics and audit. No central authority; only a federation for coordination and peer review.

→ Unity through standards, not hierarchy.

---

## 6. Rotation and Redundancy

Facilitators, treasurers, and scribes rotate regularly. Every role has a backup; no one is indispensable.

→ Power circulates or it stagnates.

---

## 7. Service Over Status

No career ladder, no special robes, no enlightenment badges. Contribution = cleaning the floor, taking minutes, helping others, marketing.

→ Prestige measured by usefulness, not image.

---

## 8. Integration With the World

No retreat from ordinary life, no compounds. Members keep jobs, families, civic duties.

→ The world is the monastery.

---

## 9. Permanent Right to Leave

Anyone can walk away without penalty, stigma, or fear of exclusion from social life. Leaving is treated as natural evolution, not betrayal.

→ Freedom is the ultimate safeguard.
