# Active Experiments

This document tracks experimental branches being tested in practice. Experiments allow us to test changes before adopting them into the main documents.

<!--
### Template for listing experiments:

### [Experiment Name]
- **Branch**: `experiment/branch-name`
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Testing duration**: X weeks/months
- **Who's testing**: [circle name / format type / number of participants]
- **Purpose**: [What problem does this address? What are we learning?]
- **Status**: 🧪 Testing | 📅 Review scheduled | ✅ Adopted | ❌ Declined | ⏸️ Paused
- **Review meeting**: [scheduled date or "TBD"]
- **Discussion**: [link to GitHub issue]
-->

## How to Propose an Experiment

1. **Open a GitHub issue** with tag `experiment-proposal`
2. Describe: What you want to test, why, and for how long
3. Discuss with interested people
4. Create the experimental branch
5. Add it to this file
6. Test it in practice
7. Hold formal review meeting when ready
8. Update status based on outcome

See **[docs/framework/HOW_WE_CHANGE.md](docs/framework/HOW_WE_CHANGE.md)** for full experimental branch process.

## Experiment Guidelines

### Good experiments:
- Address a real problem or question
- Have clear testing criteria ("We'll know it works if...")
- Define who will test and for how long
- Document learnings regardless of outcome

### Remember:
- Not every experiment needs to be adopted
- Failed experiments teach us what doesn't work
- Some experiments need longer testing than others
- It's okay to pause or stop an experiment early if it's clearly not working
